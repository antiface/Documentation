### Breadcrumbs (in the Workspace)
* I do not have a perfect accounting system or system of recordkeeping, bookkeeping, documentation, archiving, etc.;
* In fact, I don't believe that a perfect system of this sort can ever exist, i.e. it's always a "Work-in-Progress";
* A system, or parts of a system, can be inefficient or suboptimal. That is, not everything needs to be optimized in such a system;
* Another way to put it is: CHOOSE YOUR BATTLES. There is no perfect system;
* Therefore, I do not have an optimal system for keeping track of everything;
* For instance, I might spend an appreciable amount of time looking for things. In designing the system, I found this reasonable since I generally enjoy looking for things;
* The system is far from perfect, but everything that needs to be logged, is definitely being logged somewhere;
* In a sense, what I have built functions as a kind of "distributed ledger";
* I use a "breadcrumb" method, meaning that wherever I am in the workspace, I am continuously logging what I'm doing;
* I have logs for the concepts and themes that I am working with/on in both my research and my art practice, called my ConceptLogs;
* I keep track of problems, too, that I encounter, and document the solutions and the process I went through to get to the solutions, called my ProblemSolutionLog;
* I have many logs which are distributed all around the workspace. I log what I'm doing and leave myself these "breadcrumbs".

### Breadcrumbs: Rationale
* In the workspace, in general, I always use timestamps and when I "leave off", I write what the last thing was that I was doing;
* In this way, I never lose track of what I'm doing, and I can reconstruct temporal orders of things based on my multiple log-files (since everything is timestamped, even multiple times per page in my notebooks, i.e. I use a timestamp every time I write something down basically);
* What happened over time, over decades of time actually, is that I learned that using centralized repositories for notes and logs and so forth was a very provably wrong and brokenway of going about things;
* History, or the forces of History, have taught me time and again that notebooks are not eternal. They can be damaged, lost, stolen, your system can be sabotaged, your house can burn down or be flooded, etc.;
* In short, one wants to avoid central repositories, and also one has to chose what one should be logging/documenting/archiving;
* One cannot log, document, and archive "EVERYTHING". The archive will be too big or there will be too much noise, it will be difficult to find things, if not impossible, it will be costly and also one just doesn't NEED to log everything;
* One only has to log and archive important things, not something like a catalogue of the television shows that I've watched over the course of a year, unless of course that is pertinent to the work I'm doing, is important to note, etc.;
* The "objects" that are scattered about, call them repos or repositories or notebooks, which are mostly log-files, these must contain timestampes. I cannot stress this enough;
* One "period" of time or else one time "segment", time "slice", or an "event" is itself also an "object" as far as the workspace and its history (and archives) are concerned;
* The log-file is made up of these atomic parts which are ENTRIES in the ledger or accounting system. Every surface where I have "left off", then, should contain such "objects", with timestamps and data/metadata about what I was doing;
* These are the "breadcrumbs", which can be used to retrace my steps at any given time and place, and reconstruct the temporal order of events, things, in the history of the workspace;
* It is important that these "breadcrumbs" be treated as "objects", like the timestamp itself is an object ("object-within-an-object");

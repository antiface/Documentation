# Refinement Process
*I have updated my daily bookkeeping/accounting/documentary practices to reflect where I am at in March, 2023. This is my Current Refinement Process.*
* At or near the beginning of the year I create a "Notes" file;
* It is in the .txt format, for longevity (.txt files should be around for a long time still);
* For example, this year`s "Notes" file is simply called __NOTES_2023.txt__;
* I log everything I read in this file, as well as everything I write;
* It's my main file for everything;
* Then I create another file for each day with names, like the current one with a timestamp at the end, ex: __MARCH_16_2023_DAYBOOK_NOTES_16Mar23a-03h55a.txt__;
* The "Daybook" file is made up of important excerpts from my "Notes" file;
* This is how the refinement process works;
* It's almost like a kind of alchemy;
* After that, since I like to copy pertinent content from Wikipedi, I creat a "WikiWalks" file, i.e. __WIKIWALKS_223.txt__;
* This text file contains a log of all the Wikipedia content I find important, and each entry has a timestamp before the quote text;
* I then have a __LOGS_2023.txt__ is a logfile which contains ALL of the websites I visit over the year;
* I use a browser extension which allows me to save all my open tabs in various formats;
* I log the websites in .csv format, because I want to be able to manipulate it with Python;
* I then copy the same list of open tabs, but in Markdown format (.md) in a Github Gist, so I have a backup copy online, called something like __LOGS_2023.md__;
* I also add all of these files to Google Drive as well as uploading it to an portable flash drive, for safekeeping;
* From the "Notes" file, through the "Daybook" file, I put theme-based or concept-based materials in another type of file for which I give a descriptive name, for example __RATES_OF_DECAY_14Mar23a-11h15a.txt__;
* As you can see, this also has a timestamp of when I first created the file;
* I timestamp every file, except my main LOGS and NOTES documents, which are for an entire Production-Year;

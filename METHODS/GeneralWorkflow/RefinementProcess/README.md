# Refinement Process
*I have updated my daily bookkeeping/accounting/documentary practices to reflect where I am at in March, 2023. This is my Current Refinement Process.*
* At or near the beginning of the year I create a "Notes" file;
* It is in the .txt format, for longevity (.txt files should be around for a long time still);
* For example, this year`s "Notes" file is simply called __NOTES_2023.txt__;
* I log everything I read in this file, as well as everything I write;
* It's my main file for everything;
* Then I create another file for each day with names, like the current one with a timestamp at the end, ex: __MARCH_16_2023_DAYBOOK_NOTES_16Mar23a-03h55a.txt__;
* The "Daybook" file is made up of important excerpts from my "Notes" file;
* This is how the refinement process works;
* It's almost like a kind of alchemy;
* After that, since I like to copy pertinent content from Wikipedi, I creat a "WikiWalks" file, i.e. __WIKIWALKS_2023.txt__;
* This text file contains a log of all the Wikipedia content I find important, and each entry has a timestamp before the quote text;
* I then have a __LOGS_2023.txt__ is a logfile which contains ALL of the websites I visit over the year;
* I use a browser extension which allows me to save all my open tabs in various formats;
* I log the websites in .csv format, because I want to be able to manipulate it with Python;
* I then copy the same list of open tabs, but in Markdown format (.md) in a Github Gist, so I have a backup copy online, called something like __LOGS_2023.md__;
* I also add all of these files to Google Drive as well as uploading it to an portable flash drive, for safekeeping;
* From the "Notes" file, through the "Daybook" file, I put theme-based or concept-based materials in another type of file for which I give a descriptive name, for example __RATES_OF_DECAY_14Mar23a-11h15a.txt__;
* As you can see, this also has a timestamp of when I first created the file;
* I timestamp every file, except my main LOGS and NOTES documents, which are for an entire Production-Year;
* I timestamo every entry in every file, making them LOGS essentially;
* This is the so-called "Refinement Process", going from a complete log of everything, to a smaller log with the most pertinent stuff and then I keep all my open tabs in a file as well as concept-related reference materials;
* I am also constantly looking through my archives of documents, often searching for a given keyword, and I put all of those in another .txt file, with the name of the concept in the filename, such as: __DATA_WAREHOUSES_THROUGH_THE_AGES_05June15a.txt__;
* That particular file contains all mentions of "Data Warehouses" in my archives;
* I also keep the content of articles I read on-line that I find especially great, and name it with the title of the article, the word "Article", and as always, a timestamp at the end of the filename;
* I quote a great deal from books I'm reading and often even transcribe things by hand;
* I keep those in the main logfile, i.e. __LOGS_2023.txt__, and do as I said, go through the various levels of the "Refinement Process"
* That's it for now; this is my latest work methodology;
* I also keep copies of old files in each new year's File Folder, which I put in the main "Documents" folder, with just the year, i.e. "2023";
* Redundancy as you can see is built into the system, i.e .txt files go through a refinement process and any given .txt file, as well as images, I create or else download online, they all go into the yearly folder;
* I back up my the entire contents of my folders on Google Drive, except for the spreadsheets for my budget;
* I then back all new files on a USB drive, also;
* Using this system so far, I haven't lost any content and I have the same content in multiple places, in a kind of "distributed" manner;
* Another log which I keep is called the "Daypath" file, one for every year, i.e. __DAYPATHS_2023.txt__;
* This file contains my daily routine and activities, mostly so I can review the entries (with timestamps!) the next day;

## More On The Refinement Process:
* I know that this is almost criminal for a researcher, but I copy content from Wikipedia onto my computer A LOT;
* It's not quality content, but it's easy to navigate and it is EXTREMELY COMPREHENSIVE;
* It's an *encyclopedia for the People*;
* Now, in my Refinement Process of different .txt files, Wikipedia content ends up being repeated THREE TIMES, logged and saved in THREE PLACES: The "Notes" file, the "Daybook" file, AND the "WikiWalks" file;
* I spoke of redundancy in this process and I can't stress it enough => Redundancy will save your life;
* Redundancy will save you from what I tentatively call *archival collapse*;
* Soren Kierkegaard is one of my all-time favorite authors and he is constantly reformulating his previous phrases;
* Why is that, you think? Personally, I think it's because he understood the quality and nature of redundancy in WRITING: Redundancy has been used in writing *since the Beginning*;
* Monastic scribes ended up transcribing documents *multiple times*;
* There were no Xerox photocopiers during that period, so people, scribes and so on, needed to copy things out by hand;
* Since copying always introduces *errors in the text*, you needed a form of what today might be called *error-correction*;
* They did this, in part, by making multiple copies, and then historians and historiographers could later look at these multiple copies, as source material, and *compare them*;
* Transcription errors will rarely happen at the same place, so by comparing multiple source documents, one can come to a sort of *original sourcecode*;
* You just cancel out the *stray errors* and *maintain the integrity of the rest of the Text*;
* This is in part why I copy everything in multple places, in multple .txt files on my local computer, and then copy them onto a cloud service such as Google Drive, OneDrive by Microsoft, or Dropbox, and probably much of the time, *all of the above*;
* I copy my files on an external drive, on a USB drive that I keep on me at all times, and I have another external drive hidden in a completely different location;
* I live by the river, and if the river ever overflowed and destroyed my home, I wouldn't lose a shred of data;
* The worst that can happen is that I lose PART OF A FILE, *before backup*;
* That happens, sometimes computers crash and so forth, or a file gets corrupted;
* Yet, since I started keeping logs in 1994, I have lost only ONE DOCUMENT, a text called __Angel__, which is probably the best thing I ever wrote, but I was inexperienced back then and the file got corrupted when I saved it, and I lost the data forever;
* The file was irrecuperable; the best I got was what I could remember from that moment of intense inspiration, and that wasn't all that much;
* [...]

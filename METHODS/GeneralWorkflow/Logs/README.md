### LOGS/LOGGING
* Types of Logfiles maintained daily:
    * LOG_datestamp.txt - Ongoing logging of all web resources visited, utilized;
    * ConceptProblemLog - Logs of problems I encounter in my daily practice + the troubleshooting process, documentation of the finding of solutions and so forth;
    * RECALL - Retrieval practice, kept in general log format;
    * GeneralJournalLog - Financial reporting, accounting, accountancy, accountability;
    * FIELDNOTES - Obvious what this is;
    * LABNOTES - Same, but inside the lab (otherwise, "in the field");
    * WORKSPACE_SNAPSHOT - Regular screen-captures of work important to retain and see at future date/for future reference;

#### Potential practices
* Keeping several types of interlinked/interconnected logs can be a useful form of documentation of the processes of an organization;
* A log can have many data types, it can take on or contain many different data structures;
* Logs are always timestamped/datestamped;
* Try to be as regular as possible in your logging practices;
* Do reviews and "clean_ups" when you do backups;
* Keep some physical logfiles, journals, dossiers, etc.;
* Index cards are still a useful form of documentation;
* Researchers could ideally share "Cardboxes" across the web;

__DISTRIBUTED LOGGING METHODOLOGY (AND ITS BENEFITS!):__
* What was written above this current update - and documentation/logging - was written about 4 years ago, if I am not mistaken, or was at the very least last updated at around that time;
* Above I mentioned that *"Keeping several types of interlinked/interconnected logs can be a useful form of documentation of the processes of an organization"*; I will say a few things about this, a specific use-case which I am calling, for lack of a better term, a *"distributed logging methodology"*;
* *More to come, soon!*;

### LOGS/LOGGING
* Types of Logfiles maintained daily:
    * LOG_datestamp.txt - Ongoing logging of all web resources visited, utilized;
    * ConceptProblemLog - Logs of problems I encounter in my daily practice + the troubleshooting process, documentation of the finding of solutions and so forth;
    * RECALL - Retrieval practice, kept in general log format;
    * GeneralJournalLog - Financial reporting, accounting, accountancy, accountability;
    * FIELDNOTES - Obvious what this is;
    * LABNOTES - Same, but inside the lab (otherwise, "in the field");

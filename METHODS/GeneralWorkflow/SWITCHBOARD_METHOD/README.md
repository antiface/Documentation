__*The Switchboard Method:*__
* Take __*n*__ number of tasks;
* Choose one task at a time, work on it for approximately 15 minutes, then __SWITCH TASKS__;
* Continue doing this continuously throughout the day, switching tasks every 5-10 or 15 minutes;
* Switch tasks __*pseudo-randomly*__, that is, choose whatever task is most __*immediate*__;
* Choose whatever tasks is most relevant to the given time;
* Choose tasks that are more __*ready-to-hand*__ either physically *proximate* or else *close* to you in your *cognitive space*, *emotional space*, your __*Fields of Experience*__ or __*Fields of Discourse*__;
* Act as though you were a __MECHANICAL TURK__ at Amazon;
* You will achieve most efficiency this way;
* Take an example. Say someone writes 1 novel in 1 notebook;
* Now you write 12 novels in 12 notebooks, except you use the __SWITCHBOARD METHOD__;
* The other person might finish their 1 novel in __*x amount of time*__;
* You will finish in __*x+y amount of time*__, __*y*__ being a constant;
* It will take you a little more time to write 12 novels across 12 notebooks instead of 1 across 1, but at the end of _*x+y time*__, you will have written __12 NOVELS INSTEAD OF 1__;
* The __SWITCHBOARD METHOD__ is essentially a __*NON-LINEAR METHOD OF WORK ORGANIZATION*__ and can provide *Great Efficiencies in Time* (awaiting *mathematical proof*);

* I am told this is the __*assignment problem*__ in theoretical computer science,but usually you have __n agents__ to whom you must assign __m number of tasks__;
* In my case, there are only __n tasks__ and __1 agent__;
* All that's really important here is the decision problem and efficient allocation of resources;
* You would normally look at costs and so forth, cost functions, etc.;
* Thats not my problem, though; I got rid of the decision problem and saved at least __1 bit__;
* It might not seem like a lot, yet computationally, with over __100 projects__ still actively running in my *Art Operation*, I needed to save *as many bits as possible*;
* I don't *decide* what task to work on; I tackle whatever is most __proximate/immediate/ready-and-near-at-hand__;
* It doesn't matter what it is,it will absolutely be an __enriching,learning experience__;
* Randomized task assignment just seems optimal to me; I'm able to maintain over 100 complex,interdisciplinary art-research projects, and I'm a __*One-Man Shop*__, a single art operator at the __*Art Operation @ The Historiotheque*__;
* More on this later; this is based on the research for a new project, and series of series, I started earlier in the year,called __*NOISE IN THE WORKSPACE*__;
* The first series was called __*SPACE NOISE INJECTION*__ and, you see, while the first series is still only beginning, I started the second series of experiments, called __*RANDOMIZED EXPERIMENTAL PARAMETERS*__;
* After just a few months, I have enough research and experimental data to write a PhD thesis in __interruption science__;

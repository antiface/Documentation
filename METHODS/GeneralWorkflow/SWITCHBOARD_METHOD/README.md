__*The Switchboard Method:*__
* Take __*n*__ number of tasks;
* Choose one task at a time, work on it for approximately 15 minutes, then __SWITCH TASKS__;
* Continue doing this continuously throughout the day, switching tasks every 5-10 or 15 minutes;
* Switch tasks __*pseudo-randomly*__, that is, choose whatever task is most __*immediate*__;
* Choose whatever tasks is most relevant to the given time;
* Choose tasks that are more __*ready-to-hand*__ either physicall *proximate* or else *close* to you in your *cognitive space*, *emotional space*, your __*Fields of Experience*__ or __*Fields of Discourse*__;
* Act as though you were a __MECHANICAL TURK__ at Amazon;
* You will achieve most efficiency this way;
* Take an example. Say someone writes 1 novel in 1 notebook;
* Now you write 12 novels in 12 notebooks, except you use the __SWITCHBOARD METHOD__;
* The other person might finish their 1 novel in __*x amount of time*__;
* You will finish in __*x+y amount of time*__, __*y*__ being a constant;
* It will take you a little more time to write 12 novels across 12 notebooks instead of 1 across 1, but at the end of _*x+y time*__, you will have written __12 NOVELS INSTEAD OF 1__;
* The __SWITCHBOARD METHOD__ is essentially a __*NON-LINEAR METHOD OF WORK ORGANIZATION*__ and can provide *Great Efficiencies in Time* (awaiting *mathematical proof*);

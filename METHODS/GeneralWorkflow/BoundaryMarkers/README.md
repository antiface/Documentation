### The Use of Boundary Markers in The Workspace (METHOD/RATIONALE)
* Boundaries, and things that "mark" or "indicate" boundaries are of great importance in many domains;
* In an interdisciplinary art practice such as mine, including lots of various research activities, etc., I have found that setting boundaries has been of utmost importance; It is important to not only SET boundaries, but RESPECT set boundaries; (and also when others are involved, it's important to "enforce" if you will the respect of those boundaries that you set;
* A simple example of how I have begun using "boundary markers" is in my writing;
* I am constantly taking notes inside various notebooks and now what I do, after I put the ordinary TIMESTAMP, I write another stamp I call "Opus Incipit". This means that this is the "start" of the "writing session", i.e. the "Work Begins", a.k.a. the [START_SIGNAL];
* When I am about to LEAVE the session, or END it, I put another stamp, the [STOP_SIGNAL] or [END_SIGNAL], which I write as "Finis Opera";
* That way, my notebooks all have writing that is delimited by start- and stop-signals which demarcate the actual writing "sessions";
* The thing is, I do this in almost all my activities. If I am painting, I put on a painting "shawl" of sorts, a "chemise", which serves to protect my clothing from getting paint on it, but also reminds me that I am "beginning" a painting "session"; When I'm done painting, I clean my brushes, clear the area, put my materials away, and then eventually take off the chemise and return to normal everyday life;
* When one leaves the house, one closes and I presume one locks the front door; This is the same kind of start/stop signaling I have been describing. The thing is, nowadays, with our "always-on" mobile and web experiences that are essentially "continuous" and "seamless", I find that we are lacking proper "boundary markers" as I call them, FOR these experiences (or "sessions" therein);
* For example, a book has a title page and at the end it used to say "THE END", like in film or television, with opening and closing "credits" or similar "titles";
* Even in silent cinema, there were "INTERTITLES" that functioned as a sort of "rhythmic" type "punctuation" if you will, of various "sequences" often separated by short "intertitle" sequences;

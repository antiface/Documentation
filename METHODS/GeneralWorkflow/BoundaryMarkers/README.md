### The Use of Boundary Markers in The Workspace (METHOD/RATIONALE)
* Boundaries, and things that "mark" or "indicate" boundaries are of great importance in many domains;
* In an interdisciplinary art practice such as mine, including lots of various research activities, etc., I have found that setting boundaries has been of utmost importance; It is important to not only SET boundaries, but RESPECT set boundaries; (and also when others are involved, it's important to "enforce" if you will the respect of those boundaries that you set, i.e. "commanding respect");
* A simple example of how I have begun using "boundary markers" is in my writing;
* I am constantly taking notes inside various notebooks and now what I do, after I put the ordinary TIMESTAMP, I write another stamp I call "Opus Incipit". This means that this is the "start" of the "writing session", i.e. the "Work Begins", a.k.a. the [START_SIGNAL];
* When I am about to LEAVE the session, or END it, I put another stamp, the [STOP_SIGNAL] or [END_SIGNAL], which I write as "Finis Opera";
* That way, my notebooks all have writing that is delimited by start- and stop-signals which demarcate the actual writing "sessions";
* The thing is, I do this in almost all my activities. If I am painting, I put on a painting "shawl" of sorts, a "chemise", which serves to protect my clothing from getting paint on it, but also reminds me that I am "beginning" a painting "session"; When I'm done painting, I clean my brushes, clear the area, put my materials away, and then eventually take off the chemise and return to normal everyday life;
* When one leaves the house, one closes and I presume one locks the front door; This is the same kind of start/stop signaling I have been describing. The thing is, nowadays, with our "always-on" mobile and web experiences that are essentially "continuous" and "seamless", I find that we are lacking proper "boundary markers" as I call them, FOR these experiences (or "sessions" therein);
* For example, a book has a title page and at the end it used to say "THE END", like in film or television, with opening and closing "credits" or similar "titles";
* Even in silent cinema, there were "INTERTITLES" that functioned as a sort of "rhythmic" type "punctuation" if you will, of various "sequences" often separated by short "intertitle" sequences;

### Boundary markers as Endpoints/Terminus-Points
* When one begins to realize the importance of carefully delimited boundaries and the respect of these boundaries, and when one begins to observe this in all things, much becomes clear that maybe wasn't before;
* Lately, I have begun calling the work that I do "Field Art". In Field Art, I do two things. I go "out into the field" and do various forms of data-collection, data-logging, etc., and then when I get back into the Studio or Atelier, I create art based on my field materials, amongst other things;
* What I have noticed recently is that I also need to carefully "delimit" the FIELD when I am as I said, "out in the field"; This is non-trivial, not obvious;
* The other part of field art is that I am recreating "fields" in my visual work as in my audio work; In that regard it is an "Atmospheric Art", I build, create, Atmospheres; One can see it as building "Rooms" of sorts, through a careful understanding of the dynamics of Rooms, and the design principles behind the construction of Atmospheres/Rooms, or various "Spaces" as I often call them;
* I firmly believe that it is imperative that I always carefully delimit the Field-in-Question or Field-at-Hand; I do this through the use of Boundary markers, a.k.a. Endpoints/Punctuating-Intertitles/Terminus-Points;
* Since thinking itself as well as direct, immediate sensory-perception of oneself and one's surroundings tends to be more or less experienced as "continuous", as a continuous process / continuous flow, it can be useful to use boundary-creation standards such as I have described, to in essence learn to "discretize" these kinds of experiences;
* It is the same thing when I am painting, i.e. I am in a "flow" state, time stands still, etc. It is therefore important to me that I properly demarcate the "endpoints" of this more or less "continuous" experience. That way I "discretize" it, the painting "session" becomes like an "object" that I can later use, both in my experience and experiential memory of it as well as whatever documentation I may have put to paper ABOUT IT, and of course the session is revealed through the finished product itself, the painting;

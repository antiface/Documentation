# GENERAL WORKFLOW

(Methods constantly being retired, updated)

## Abridged Basic Daily Workflow
1. First thing, top of the morning, is to open up a new .txt file called "DAYPATH_CURRENTDATE.txt" which contains a rough outline of what I need to get done today;
2. Second, I start a "LOG_CURRENTDATE.txt" file where I will keep a running record of all of the web sites / web resources that I use in the course of the day;
3. I then open up my latest  "ConceptLog.txt" and latest "ProblemSolutionLog.txt" files;
    * a) The former contains a running record of all of the concepts and themes that I am currently working on/with in both my artistic practice AND my accompanying interdisciplinary research;
    * b) The latter contains a running record of #PROBLEMS that I encounter in my everyday life and work and their #SOLUTIONS;
4. I then can usually start working, going through my #DAYPATH file, item by item;
5. I also begin taking notes in various notebooks, I also do experiments in painting or sound design or whatnot and write "LabNotes" for those (which I post in a repository on Github as well as on a blog called "AntiLog");
6. Periodically, I print things out, Wikipedia articles or blog posts, essays and so forth (in PDF or other format). I am constantly printing stuff out - what I call "print-outs" - which I read and then file away in file folders in my filing cabinets (I have two filing cabinets next to my desk);
    * a) Each folder has a "start_date" and "end_date", and I try to stamp each of my print-outs with a timestamp, so I know in what order I printed and read them; (everything else goes in my various "LOG" files;
    * b) Eventually, file folders are retired to the filing cabinets;
    * c) Periodically, I go through old folders in the filing cabinets and I "compress" them, I call it. Simply put, I open the folder, go through it item by item, and I discard or throw out everything that either is not necessary to keep or else is something from Wikipedia or something that I can easily find on-line on some future date, should I ever need to;
    * d) I go through each item in the folder, writing down the Titles of every article in a new .txt file - or on an index card, or sheet of paper - which I then attach to the front cover of the folder. What this does is limit or constrain the SIZE of my personal archives. I constantly do this in the course of my work to ensure that my archives are "manageable". I call it a form of "history-compression" (it is a form of INDEX and/or simply Metadata ABOUT the contents (data) of a given file folder);
7. Also upon waking, I check my email and other messages and do a bit of monitoring of the news. I do these "clerical" activities, if you will, on a daily basis, throughout the course of the day, when I'm not too busy with other more important stuff;
8. I also have reading periods where as I said, I read my printed materials ("print-outs") as well as books that I have recently purchased or else am re-reading for purposes of reference; (I also read on the computer, PDFs and so forth, or on-line on my computer(s) or else on my tablet);
9. In any case, other than that, I am either painting or composing/playing/recording music (or doing sound design), or else I'm writing something, a novel I am working on or a philosophical essay, or just taking random notes of my thoughts and so forth (and my rants, which I keep a log of). I might work on a bibliography or else I'm tweeting things or posting things on-line, everything from sounds to images to texts;
10. Also, and in conclusion, I am constantly going over my various methods and "optimizing" them. I look at what's not working in the current state of the system and make corrections. I also have an archive of visual arts materials, art objects, that I maintain. I spend a lot of time "In The Archives" as I like to say, going over stuff, making sure everything is properly "bagged & tagged", making sure everything is findable and whatnot, organized, classified properly, etc. I also write code, mostly in Python, which takes a lot of my time, as does the various learning materials that I am consuming on-line, whether in the form of more formal "MOOCs" or else just videos, podcasts, etc. etc.

In any case, I often tell people that my interdisciplinary art and research practice mostly consists of two things: TROUBLESHOOTING and BOOKKEEPING. I'm not joking when I say this. Maintaining the "methods" or "system" listed above, one can easily see how troubleshooting and bookkeeping would be a natural part of the process. The filing system, for instance, which consists of hundreds of folder as well as thousands of index cards and various other related materials is basically a day job all on its own. What I hope to get too soon is a description of how all this stuff "fits together" in the general everyday running of what I call an "Art Operation", a.k.a. "A Day In The Life Of The Historiothèque". (For a general description of the Workspace, see: [Historiotopia](https://github.com/Historiomics/Historiotopia))

## NOTES & LOGS
* In general, I'm constantly taking notes, documenting my processes, procedures, methodologies. I have several notebooks going at any given time. One is always placed next to my desk. I take ample notes in this notebook whenever I am working at the computer, or in the "office" generally (I actually work in an office/art studio/recording studio, a workspace I call "The Historiothèque". See: [Historiotheque](https://github.com/antiface/Historiotheque));
* I also do a great deal of "logging" on the computer, and also in various notebooks reserved for that purpose;
* To give you an idea of what my various logging and related activities might look like on my computer, on the Desktop, here is what a folder/directory structure might look like. This isn't what I am using, it's just an example of a "Schema" I might use, to illustrate how everything that is important to me, and important enough to LOG, effectively gets LOGGED in various places in the directories. And so, for example, we might have:

### IMPORTANT UPDATE TO GENERAL WORKFLOW:

November 24th, 2023
* I start the day with prayer and meditation, contemplation, and __Edifying Readings__ (TIME: up to 1-2 hours);
* I check for important messages I may need to respond to today (TIME: 15-20 minutes);
* Morning Constitutional: A walk and/or breakfast and self-care (TIME: 1 hour);
* Philosophical readings (TIME: 1-2 hours);
* Check previous posting online (15-20 minutes);
* Open up the [**WORKSPACE**](https://medium.com/design-science/workspace-906aded7edb2) mostly the way it was when you last left it (2-3 minutes);
* Begin artistic work (TIME: 8-10 hours, with a 15-20 minute break for lunch, plus breaks every 15 to 30-45 minutes for prayer, meditation, contemplation, edifying readings, walk around the block, a quick run to the cornerstore, or excercise, stretching, The Feldenkrais Method, or Taiji Qigong);

November 25th, 2023
* I keep __LOGS__ of *EVERY WEBSITE* I ever visit; I scan and navigate the web, open up new tabs, and once I hit more than 20 tabs or say, or I want to *Close The Workspace* for the time being, or because I am *Closing The Computer* to leave the house to go on a walk or some appointment or social activity, I *__COLLAPSE ALL TABS DOWN TO NOTHING AND CLOSE THE BROWSER__*;
* I learned that it's important to *__BUILD UP A WORKSPACE + A WORK SESSION__* and then to learn to *__BREAK IT ALL DOWN__*;
* I see is as a [__BABEL UP / BABEL DOWN__](https://medium.com/the-painters-almanach/the-tower-of-incompleteness-and-incomprehension-bc804a449845) process, or raising up BABEL from the ground up and then having it be DESTROYED (by the Hand of History Herself);
* *Also*, the more one gets used to "closing down" the workspace after every __*WORK SESSION*__, the better one's memory gets of what the previous *Configuration* was of the *Virtual Workspace*;
* For that's what is truly risky for *Losing Operational Continuity* => If your *Workspace Configurations Get Lost*; you need a way to be able to __*RESTORE*__ them;
* I am also engaged in *Continuous, Rigorous, Comprehensive Documentation Practices*;
* That is to say, alongside the constant *Saving of Complete, Visited Tab-Sets*, I document __ALL__ of my other practices;
* Either I post stuff about *Project*, *Series*, *Collection*, the entire *Practice Itself*, or any part of any of the above, __*ON MY VARIOUS GITHUB REPOSITORIES*__ or else I post *Write-Ups* on Medium or Substack or else Tweet out various things like *Pictures of my Workspace*, *Scans of Actual Refcards*, etc.;
* I am building up the new [__HISTORIOTHEQUE__](https://historiotheque.ca/) website and realizing that __*I AM ALSO A HISTORIOTHEQUE!*__;
* My dream of the *Mobile Recording Studio* has become a reality, with my *Smart Phone*;

November 26th, 2023
* After __*WORKING IN THE ARCHIVES*__ at partially *Dismantling* them, that is, reducing it to its bare minimum so it still retains maximal value while minimizing size and complexity (reduction of complexity through proper classification and tagging, documentation, etc.), and __*AFTER*__ I have worked out in the field to collect data and have brought it back into the *Laboratory* ("__THE HISTORIOTHEQUE__"), I start publishing the *Documentation* AND publishing my *high-quality content*;
* *I cross-post on at least 12 different platforms or sites*; it doesn't take that long, I have a *streamlined workflow management methodology* the __*AG METHOD*__, also known as __*ALX*__;
* Each platform or site has its own unique audience, with some necessary overlap; but I adapt the content to each of the sites/platforms;
* I don't just publish __EVERYTHING EVERYWHERE__ because *"Everywhere means nowhere"* ([*Moral letters to Lucilius by Seneca: Letter 2. On discursiveness in reading*](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Moral_letters_to_Lucilius/Letter_2));
* I write *Write-Ups* on Medium which I often cross-post on Substack; I share those on Threads or on Twitter or both, sometimes also cross-posted on my Facebook profile AND/OR my professional Facebook Page;
* I *Lifelog* on Threads, because it's a high-velocity platform where you can post multiple times per day and it's actually good for *Engagement*;
* I spend a little time a few times a day *Reading* other people's posts mainly on Threads, *Liking* and *Commenting* and otherwise *Interacting* with others;
* I *Clean Up* around the house, which houses [__*THE HISTORIOTHEQUE*__](https://historiotheque.ca/); you've got to keep things clean;
* The *Art Operation @ The Historiotheque* also gets __*built up then torn down*__, and each new __*version*__ gets its own __*semantic version*__ and __OFFICIAL RELEASE__ (we are currently on Official Release v.3.0.4.; SEE: [Relaunch and Subsequent Closing Down of The Historiotheque Semantic Version 3.0.4.](https://medium.com/historiotheque/relaunch-and-subsequent-closing-down-of-the-historiotheque-semantic-version-3-0-4-94714c1d73b5);
* Lately, I've also been adding a little bit when I can to my [__*Art-Ops-In-A-Box GitHub Repository v.1.0.2.*__](https://github.com/antiface/ArtOpsInABox/tree/ArtOpsInABox-v.1.0.2);
![ART-OPS-IN-A-BOX MANUAL - "OPEN THE BOX" SCHEMA](https://historiotheque.files.wordpress.com/2023/11/screenshot-from-2023-11-26-05-19-08.png)
* I did a *Write-Up* on the __*Art-Ops-In-A-Box Concept*__ on Medium (SEE: [Art-Ops-in-a-Box: Cultural Innovation Saves Lives](https://medium.com/the-painters-almanach/art-ops-in-a-box-cultural-innovation-saves-lives-991ba30ff4e6));
* I also still keep a a main *LOG* file, ex. from this year, a .txt file called __*NOTES_2023*__ which is a running *log* of every important piece of content that I either __WRITE__ or else __COPY__ off the web, or from specific *documents*, sometimes *Transcribed by Hand*;
* Then I go through a [__*REFINEMENT PROCESS*__](https://github.com/antiface/Documentation/tree/master/METHODS/GeneralWorkflow/RefinementProcess) whereby I take *snippets* from the running *Everything-Log* and create *New Files / New Documents*, plus post *Write-Ups* online, based on the given pieces of *Content*;
* I also have a __*LOG_2023*__ file where, as before and as always, I keep a log of all the __*Tab-Sets*__, documenting *EVERY* website that I visit on the web, for purposes of leaving an __*audit trail*__ of every website I visit, for purposes of upholding the *Civic Virtues of Integrity, Transparency, Responsibility, Truth and Accountability, and Others*;
* Leaving the __*audit trail*__ is extremely important, it's so I can work __IN THE LIGHT__ as opposed to working in __DARKNESS__;
* Working __IN THE DARK__ can arouse *SUSPICION* about my behaviors; people might think I engage in secrecy, in magical behavior, or am a mystic or even an *Opus Dei member* or *Freemason*, and I represent none of those things, am just the *Chief Art Operator @ The Historiotheque* engaged in a *rigorous, comprehensive, experimental design workflow management methodology called the __AG METHOD__ or [__ALX__](https://github.com/antiface/ALX);

November 28th, 2023
* I also do a great deal of *Reading* and have my very own, unique *Methodology*;
* I have a unique *Method of Reading*; I can be reading up to 30 different books at any given time;
* If you take the last 10-20 years, then technically, I'm still in the process of finishing over 100 separate books;
* I have often been told to read only __ONE BOOK AT A TIME__, but that's just not how I operate;
* Before she died - God rest her soul! - my mom asked me once how I was able to read so many books at once, how I could possibly __KNOW WHERE I AM SITUATED__ in all those books;
* It's simple, I have a *Prodigious Memory*, first of all, and *Fantastically Great Capacity for Making and Presreving/Maintaining Deep Abstractions*;
* Here is the *Method* as it stands now;
   * Take out several pertinent books from the library, books that pertain specifically to what I am in the *Process of Understanding*;
   * Firstly, I follow my *Intuition*, not what is *Relevant to the Times*;
   * So I take out books from the library PLUS I take out all the books I want to read from my personal *Collection*;
   * I end up with about 20-30 books on the table, and I take them one by one, inspect them, look at the *Tables of Contents*, read the *Back Cover*;
   * I actually start with the __*COVERS*__; Whoever said a book can't be judged by its cover, never read books for *True Understanding*, because the covers give you a precise introduction to the subject matter and information about the author and who they were published by, where, and when, with cover art on top of that; it's the perfect tool for *Understanding the Precise Context and Relavance* of any given book for any given situation when you might need it;
   * Once I've read the *Back Cover*, I start to read the *Introduction*;
      * I go *paragraph-by-paragraph*, taking written notes as well as audio notes __OF MY CURRENT UNDERSTANDING__;
      * I read books for __UNDERSTANDING__, no other reason, so I will usually only read a few paragraphs at any given time, what would fit on what I like to call a __REFCARD__, which is an index card with concepts on it, specific yet brief *theoretical understandings*;
         * You can fit about one paragraph or a snippet from a paragraph onto one *Refcard*, so you can create __citation networks__ across any given __Card-Set__ or __Card-box__;
   * I search through my *Archive of Notes* on the subject, trying to find specific concepts I've taken notes or written about, the __DEEPEN MY UNDERSTANDING__;
* I try to take notes on various different __*substrates*__, different types of media located in different places;
* This is based on the __*principle of redundancy*__, on how it is useful in the case of tragedy and can help prevent errors;
* [...]

# Memory

Here is a new process which I use to consolidate my memory, which aids me in so many aspects of my life, it's incredible.

* First of all, every new year, I create a .txt file called __*NOTES_2023.txt*__ or with the date of creation attached, such as __*NOTES_22Dec22a-14h51a.txt*__;
* First things first: I use .txt files because the .txt format is one of the oldest digital formats for documents and is likely to be around for a very, very long time;
* Also, I am constantly concerned with and worried about the long-term preservation of all of my work and work methods, practices, projects, etc., and so elaborate methods of *Documentation* have become a daily practice;
* My yearly .txt file contains the entirety of my writing for that year, including important citations from documents I am reading; it really is the *entirety* of the *Notes* that I take down for an entire year; these files can be very big by the common standards of .txt files, but my text editors have no problem opening and managing them;
* So let's get to the point. To consolidate my memory, I repeat things many times;
* Every day, I create a new .txt file called something like __*APRIL_14_DAYBOOK_NOTES_14Apr23a-06h10a.txt*__;
* This new .txt file contains all of the content in the *NOTES* file, __*REPEATED*__ for that given day;
* Then, for each month, I copy all of the content from my *NOTES* file into a .txt file with a name something like * __*APRIL_2023_RELEVANT_CONTENT_BY_AG_14Apr23a-08h43a.txt*__;
* That way, so far, we have repeated my written documentation __*THREE TIMES*__; other stuff also gets repeated more often, as you will see;
* A lot of my notes end up becoming blog posts or content I share on social media;
* Other notes end up in *repositories* on GitHub, where I try to keep all my *Documentation*;
* Many so-called *experiments*, or contents of these *experiments*, end up in separate .txt files on my computer;
* I'm constantly saving copies of these .txt files in the cloud, currently on *Google Drive*; I also keep copies on external flash drives for safekeeping;

# Why This Matters
* The basic idea is of consolidation of what I am reading and writing; (I also take extensive notes on what I am reading, with *Citations* and *Comments*);
* The repetitive process of copying content and pasting it in different .txt files helps me have a clearer and better *Recall* of events in my life;
* A lot of the content in my __*NOTES*__ file consists of my thoughts, my running commentary on events in my life, events online, etc.;
* The more I repeat the same thoughts, just as the more I read and re-read the same reference materials, the more the *Memory*, and *Recall*, is improved;
* Now I can actually remember what I said and did on April 12th, 2023, for instance; it's not that long ago and I repeated the content so many times, and parsed it into so many .txt files, that I have a better understanding and more consolidated memory of it;
* Making citations *by hand* of things I read and re-read helps me consolidate and __*integrate*__ the content;
* For instance, I have been going through my extensive library of books and re-reading all of my favorite passages, and making *Citations* of the very best content;
* I then *Review* it in my mind, then re-read my citations/notes, then *Copy* it onto the computer in my *running .txt files*, the list of things I do goes on;

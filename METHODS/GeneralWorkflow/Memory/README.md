# Memory

Here is a new process which I use to consolidate my memory, which aids me in so many aspects of my life, it's incredible.

* First of all, every new year, I create a .txt file called __*NOTES_2023.txt*__ or with the date of creation attached, such as __*NOTES_22Dec22a-14h51a.txt*__;
* First things first: I use .txt files because the .txt format is one of the oldest digital formats for documents and is likely to be around for a very, very long time;
* Also, I am constantly concerned with and worried about the long-term preservation of all of my work and work methods, practices, projects, etc., and so elaborate methods of *Documentation* have become a daily practice;
* My yearly .txt file contains the entirety of my writing for that year, including important citations from documents I am reading; it really is the *entirety* of the *Notes* that I take down for an entire year; these files can be very big by the common standards of .txt files, but my text editors have no problem opening and managing them;
* So let's get to the point. To consolidate my memory, I repeat things many times;
* Every day, I create a new .txt file called something like __*APRIL_14_DAYBOOK_NOTES_14Apr23a-06h10a.txt*__;
* This new .txt file contains all of the content in the *NOTES* file, __*REPEATED*__ for that given day;
* Then, for each month, I copy all of the content from my *NOTES* file into a .txt file with a name something like * __*APRIL_2023_RELEVANT_CONTENT_BY_AG_14Apr23a-08h43a.txt*__;
* That way, so far, we have repeated my written documentation __*THREE TIMES*__; other stuff also gets repeated more often, as you will see;
* A lot of my notes end up becoming blog posts or content I share on social media;
* Other notes end up in *repositories* on GitHub, where I try to keep all my *Documentation*;
* Many so-called *experiments*, or contents of these *experiments*, end up in separate .txt files on my computer;
* I'm constantly saving copies of these .txt files in the cloud, currently on *Google Drive*; I also keep copies on external flash drives for safekeeping;

# Why This Matters
* The basic idea is of consolidation of what I am reading and writing; (I also take extensive notes on what I am reading, with *Citations* and *Comments*);
* The repetitive process of copying content and pasting it in different .txt files helps me have a clearer and better *Recall* of events in my life;
* A lot of the content in my __*NOTES*__ file consists of my thoughts, my running commentary on events in my life, events online, etc.;
* The more I repeat the same thoughts, just as the more I read and re-read the same reference materials, the more the *Memory*, and *Recall*, is improved;
* Now I can actually remember what I said and did on April 12th, 2023, for instance; it's not that long ago and I repeated the content so many times, and parsed it into so many .txt files, that I have a better understanding and more consolidated memory of it;
* Making citations *by hand* of things I read and re-read helps me consolidate and __*integrate*__ the content;
* For instance, I have been going through my extensive library of books and re-reading all of my favorite passages, and making *Citations* of the very best content;
* I then *Review* it in my mind, then re-read my citations/notes, then *Copy* it onto the computer in my *running .txt files*, the list of things I do goes on;
* My *Understanding* of the reference materials (__*"#REFMATS"*__) that I keep returning to over the years has improved; the content has become more and more *Integrated* into my own *Body of Knowledge*;
* This is how *Knowledge* is created in the brain, by constantly reviewing, restating, putting into your own words, etc., of things you read, and re-reading and returning to them time and time again;
* You don't need to read 10,000 books in your lifetime; just find a few dozen *Reference Materials* and keep returning to them over time;
* If you have chosen a good book as reference material, it will last you a lifetime; but do choose a good book each time, one whose author has proven some form of *Genius*; do not read books by mediocre authors;
* I forgot to mention it, but I *timestamp* every *entry* in my __*NOTES*__ file and other .txt files;
* It's important to know when something was recorded or accessed for the first time; this forms an important and integral part of the *Documentation Process*;
* That way I can *Reconstruct* any sequence of events in the *Record*, which form part of my *Personal Archives*;
* As I said, I try to keep all *Documentation* online in repositories on GitHub, or written-up in blog posts on Medium and other sites;
* That way I not only have repeated things once more, but I am keeping a running record of things *on the Web* so that I can easily share any part of my process, my projects, work, work methods, documentation, etc., with a wider audience;

# Citations

* There's also something to be said about *Copying* citations from *Reference Works* __by hand__; Walter Benjamin wrote about this;
* Something goes on in the brain, between the hand copying and the brain registering, that is a *different form of reading*;
* It seems to be deeper than *mere surface reading*; it gets more deeply embedded in the brain somehow;
* Then copying handwritten notes onto the computer just consolidates the process even more; a great process of *Integration* takes place;
* I also use the *Zotero app* to keep references of web resources or documents I read online, whether they are web pages or other sorts of documents;
* I think it's truly important to keep good citations handy; you never know when you're going to need them;
* And good citations are always good to revisit and re-read, as that consolidates and integrates the *Knowledge* further;
* This is how I do research, in part, in my __*Interdisciplinary Art-Research Practice*__;

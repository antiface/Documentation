### DAYPATHS (METHOD)
* Ideally, every day, first thing in the morning, I open up a new DAYPATH document (in text format, i.e. .txt);
* I begin by making a quickref of what I want to do, the actual "path(s)" that I will likely follow on this given day;
* It is important for me to maintain the habit of keeping proper DAYPATH documents/logs;
* In life, in an art practice, say, one needs to be able to return to ANY given "Point-in-Time" at ANY time in the past;
* This is best achieved, I find, by the careful weaving of logfiles and various "contextual cues";
* That is to say, one should be careful to not only keep logs of what one is doing, but also DOCUMENT the processes, all processes, that one engages in;
* The problem is that even when one thinks one has done a good job at reporting or documenting something, this is often not true;
* The fact of the matter is that when we write something down, the further we jump to in the hypothetical future, the worse are the chances that we can actually READ AND UNDERSTAND WHAT WE HAVE WRITTEN!!;
* So one must be systematic, meticulous, but also profoundly REDUNDANT; REDUNDANCY always saves the day as far as this goes;

* I continue to use the __*DAYPATHS METHOD*__;
* I write what I plan to do for the day and keep a log documenting my process throughout the day;
* I also *Take Stock* or *Make an Inventory* of the previous day, usually with the day's previous __*DAYPATH*__ file open, for reference;
* I've started including relevant content in my __*DAYPATH*__ file from my main *LOGFILE* where I log absolutely everything you can think of;
* I go through that *LOG* and copy and paste elements, sections/segments, that are particularly relevant to today, to today's *Life and Work*;
* I add this content at the bottom of the __*DAYPATH*__ file under a banner called __*NOTES*__;
* As I have often mentioned elsewhere, I am constantly *searching* through my digital archive, *searching for given concepts or keywords*;
* When I find content pertaining to that concept of keyword, I copy some if not all of the contents directly into the current year's __*MAIN LOGFILE*__;
* Then that gets *Parsed* into different .txt files, depending on what the content is about;
* While I don't yet have a *Taxonomy* or *Controlled Vocabulary*, I'm working on __*SCHEMAS*__ for this work of *parsing through and classifying materials*;
* In passing, everything is kept in __*.txt format*__ because it is one of the most long-lived digital formats and probably the one that will outlive all the others, or will at least remain *fully portable* and *interoperable* for the foreseeable future, at least in my lifetime;
* __*.txt files*__ are lightweight and work on any platform, and can even easily be __*sent via email*__;
* One does not need any complex/complicated system; I just use *.txt files*;
* I am imagine a system I am calling __*THE REFCARDS-SYSTEM*__ where I could make *Connections* or *Links* between these .txt files, similar to what is done with Markdown files in a system like __*Obsidian*__;
* I have __*Obsidian*__ on all my computers, but don't really like the interface for some reason;
* Ideally, I would have a system that would merely look like the following, i.e., have just *A Search Box*;
* The rest would *immediately pop up* when you start typing;
* You would see *networks of related files*, including *your most recent user history* (__*on THE REFCARDS-SYSTEM*__);

* I gave this interface __*a noisy appeal*__ because I am a __*noise designer/synthesizer*__;

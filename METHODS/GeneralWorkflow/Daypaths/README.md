### DAYPATHS (METHOD)
* Ideally, every day, first thing in the morning, I open up a new DAYPATH document (in text format, i.e. .txt);
* I begin by making a quickref of what I want to do, the actual "path(s)" that I will likely follow on this given day;
* It is important for me to maintain the habit of keeping proper DAYPATH documents/logs;
* In life, in an art practice, say, one needs to be able to return to ANY given "Point-in-Time" at ANY time in the past;
* This is best achieved, I find, by the careful weaving of logfiles and various "contextual cues";
* That is to say, one should be careful to not only keep logs of what one is doing, but also DOCUMENT the processes, all processes, that one engages in;
* The problem is that even when one thinks one has done a good job at reporting or documenting something, this is often not true;
* The fact of the matter is that when we write something down, the further we jump to in the hypothetical future, the worse are the chances that we can actually READ AND UNDERSTAND WHAT WE HAVE WRITTEN!!;
* So one must be systematic, meticulous, but also profoundly REDUNDANT; REDUNDANCY always saves the day as far as this goes;

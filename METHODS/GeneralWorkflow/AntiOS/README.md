## AntiOS:

*2023-12-06 08:02:54*

* I had a design concept about a decade ago for an __*"AntiOS"*__ operating system, that was an *anti-operating system* or *AntiOS*;
* Essentially __*EVERYTHING*__ got put into a *Bin-Drive* or __*B:DRIVE*__;
* That is, absolutely everything was being __*LOGGED CONTINUOUSLY*__ in the infamous *B:DRIVE*;
* Then, as you work during your workday, you can create __*NEW FILES*__ such as what I call __*DAYPATH*__ files, which are all .txt files, lightweight and interoperable;
* So you would be able to go through, *scanning* through the *Bin-Drive Main Log* and copy out sequences and different sections or segments of content, i.e. *Sublogs*, and save them in a new .txt file;
* It's similar to what you could do with a *Relational Database* where you can create new *Tables* and *Relations*, or else different *Views* of content from the *Databse*, that you could then __*SAVE*__ in a new .txt file;
* Basically, what you can do during the day is __*PARSE*__ through the __*LOGS*__ in the __*B:DRIVE*__;
* You parse through it and create __*NEW .TXT FILES*__ accordingly;
* *Daypath files* for your daily work inspiration, work documentation, planning, etc.;
* Then you can have another .txt file for *Reference Materials* or __*REFMATS*__;
* Then you can __*STRUCTURE*__ your logfile's content in the *B:DRIVE* any way you like;
* You can create new files, which we are calling __*REFCARDS*__ because this is essentially a design specification for __*THE REFCARDS-SYSTEM*__;
* You can get new *Views* in many different ways, *scanning and searching* through the __*LOGFILE*_ by different *orders*, temporal, alphabetical, conceptual, etc., *organizing it in different ways;
* The system uses *machine learning to try to predict your future uses*, from using your past data as *training data*;
* Then you *build up* these new structures in a *streamlined manner* using a form of __*SEDIMENTARY METHOD*__ of using different __*STACKS*__ (SEE: [*"The Stacks-Project"*](https://github.com/antiface/Documentation/tree/master/EXPERIMENTS/StacksProject);

__*ANTIOS: codename "Antioch"*__

- You see your history as a network of objects, actions taken, documents, etc.
- No windows but "asymmetrical territories". You have a moral temp card hypervisor.
- Time quality category viewer: The Asymmetric OS.
- You can see Timelines horizontally, or navigate INTO THE SCREEN, i.e. like a Streetview, like seeing through the car window.
- All is noisy, nothing is square or skeumorphic. It looks like you are doing archaeology. It is a History-Machine.
- A History Painting. You can visually "rewind" through your "use-history".
- User stories + TimeMarks + "Restoration Points" / "Points of Restoration". Points-in-Time ("PiT" a.k.a. "PiT-stops" like "nodes").
- You navigate through territories, through "Crackland". AntiOS is a work-statioon with its own "work-graph".
- Like a personal "Fetchnotes" Super fast and responsive.
- I will make my own integrated circuit topographies. Need 100 million $$$ investment.
- The Art-Station, "Historiotheque". Navigating through the Historiosphere. Browsing through Historiomes & Antihistoriomes.
- "Historiomics" is the scripting language. "Structures", "formations", "planes", all irregular shapes.
- You can print-out "plates" throughout the course of the day, on paper.
- They help situation you, i.e. giving context. You can "switch" context like putting in tapes into a machine.
- It is a recording device. The AntiOS system is an INSTRUMENT/APPLIANCE.
- You have a data browser / editor, i.e. "Datatypes: Abstract Assembly".
- Everything is logged + everything is in the bin-drive, a.k.a. "B:Drive".
- You also have a "shortlist" of things that are "Top-of-Mind" a.k.a. "ToM".
- It makes use of human dynamics, i.e. bursts and long tail distributions.
- The logic is based on swarm logic. It uses machine learning to get to know you.
- It is an extension of (your) head-space. It is, becomes, your mind's-eye, becomes (your) second nature.
- It is based on psychophysics research. It is super minimalistic.
- It has concurrent threads, built on process calculus.

__*ANTIOS CONCEPTUAL PSEUDOCODE:*__

* B:DRIVE (BIN DRIVE) => LOG ALL DATA, STICK IT IN THE BINFILE;
* INTERFACE => USER_INPUT(USER_INPUT) + LOG(STORE) IN BIN DRIVE;

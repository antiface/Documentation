###The Ever-Changing Workspace
* What I call the "Historiotopia" is essentially the three-dimensional "surface" of the Workspace;
* At any given moment in time, the Workspace is in a current "configuration" or "state";
* The "Historiotopia" is both the current state AND can refer to the changes of such states over time;
* Every working day, the Workspace is in a state AND the state is subject to CHANGE;
* That is to say, the 3D "surface" of the Workspace changes over time, and whenever you have two "work-states" let's call them, w1 and w2, if there was a physical, "discernible" or "appreciable" CHANGE between then, then in all cases always w1 is said to "precede" w2, denoted as "w1 ≺ w2";
* Note on "precedence" and "succession": w1 precedes w2, w2 "succeeds" w1 and also we can say that the state of w2 is always "accessible" from the state w1;
* If w2 was NOT accessible from w1, then there could be no w2, the Workspace could not be in such a state;
* Without getting into too many details and abstractions, we say that thermodynamically speaking, w2 is "adiabatically accessible" from w1, meaning that

Adiabatic accessibility: A state Y is adiabatically accessible from a state X, in symbols X ≺ Y , if it is possible to change the state from X to Y by means of an interaction with some device (which may consist of mechanical and electrical parts as well as auxiliary thermodynamic systems) and a weight, in such a way that the device returns to its initial state at the end of the process whereas the weight may have changed its position in a gravitational field.

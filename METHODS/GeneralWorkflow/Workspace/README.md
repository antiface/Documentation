###The Ever-Changing Workspace
* What I call the "Historiotopia" is essentially the three-dimensional "surface" of the Workspace;
* At any given moment in time, the Workspace is in a current "configuration" or "state";
* The "Historiotopia" is both the current state AND can refer to the changes of such states over time;
* Every working day, the Workspace is in a state AND the state is subject to CHANGE;
* That is to say, the 3D "surface" of the Workspace changes over time, and whenever you have two "work-states" let's call them, w1 and w2, if there was a physical, "discernible" or "appreciable" CHANGE between then, then in all cases always w1 is said to "precede" w2, denoted as "w1 ≺ w2";
* Note on "precedence" and "succession": w1 precedes w2, w2 "succeeds" w1 and also we can say that the state of w2 is always "accessible" from the state w1;
* If w2 was NOT accessible from w1, then there could be no w2, the Workspace could not be in such a state;
* Without getting into too many details and abstractions, we say that thermodynamically speaking, w2 is "adiabatically accessible" from w1;

> Adiabatic accessibility: A state Y is adiabatically accessible from a state X, in symbols X ≺ Y , if it is possible to change the state from X to Y by means of an interaction with some device (which may consist of mechanical and electrical parts as well as auxiliary thermodynamic systems) and a weight, in such a way that the device returns to its initial state at the end of the process whereas the weight may have changed its position in a gravitational field.

### Deltas in the Workspace
* When there is a change from one "work-state" to another, we call that appreciable change a "delta";
* Deltas are usually denoted by the symbol "Δ";
* Workspaces, and changes in Workspaces, are subject to time, i.e. changes always happen "over time";
* Deltas, then, or Δs, also take place over time;
* When one enters into the Workspace, one must ask oneself: What is different here today? What has changed between the last time I was in this Workspace?;
* One must be hyper-sensitive to changes, Δs, in the Workspace;
* Changes between one Workspace (configuration) which "precedes" another W-configuration can be seen as a "mutation" process or function;
* In this case, we say that a mutation M takes workspace A as INPUT and produces the mutated workspace A' = M(A) as OUTPUT;
* Ergo, A' - A = Δ-workspace;
* That is, if time is t and what we might call the "historiotopic function" is h(t), and h(t) takes the Workspace from one configuration to the next, with an appreciable Δ or change between them, and precedence, i.e. A' is "adiabatically accessible" from A, then we can speak of the historiotopic function h(t) in terms of its "changes over time";
* What this means, and why we have taken the time to explain this briefly, is that we can quantify or measure changes in the W-config over time;
* That is why one must be hyper-sensitive to changes in conditions in the Workspace, because it's important to monitor and track these changes, for the simple reason that they "signal" important things;
* For instance, when we start monitoring changes and seeing trends and trendlines and so forth, then we can speak not only of "differences" between states/configurations but also of "derivatives" of functions like h(t);

> If the input of the function represents time, then the derivative represents change with respect to time. For example, if f is a function that takes a time as input and gives the position of a ball at that time as output, then the derivative of f is how the position is changing in time, that is, it is the velocity of the ball.

### Workspace-as-Historiothèque, Historiothèque-as-"Warehouse"
* We can therefore begin speaking of "historiotopic velocity", defined as the changes in the configuration(s) of the W-space "with respect to time";
* In essence, what we have been calling the Workspace or W-space is actually technically referred to as "The Historiothèque";à
* That is, The Historiothèque is the name of the "Art Studio" if you will, and "Office";
* The Workspace that we are imagining is Modular and the operations that take place there are multifarious, are of a wide range, variety, and are by definition interdisciplinary;
* "Velocity", then, in the Workspace or Historiothèque is an important thing to consider, since the Historiothèque is essentially a Workshop, or "manufacturing operation";
* In that regard, we can speak of INPUTS and OUTPUTs, of the "InFlow" of inputs and "OutFlow" of outputs;
* If, for the moment, we regard the Historiothèque as a kind of "Storehouse" (let's call it a "Warehouse"), then was can speak of a warehouse as having an input flow, or InFlow, of shipments from suppliers, and an output flow, or OutFlow, of shipments to customers;
* In this vein, a Warehouse is a facility that interrupts the flow of goods from the suppliers of products to the customers for those products. This is where the Historiothèque DIFFERS from a standard Warehouse: In the case of the H-house, we would say that it interrupts the flow of INPUTS, of raw materials such as art supplies, other goods, and of SIGNALS such as communications, orders, etc., FROM the outside TO the inside, and from the OUTPUTS towards the outside, TO the end-user or audience for the productions of the operating H-house;
* The H-house seen as a Manufacturing Operation, or H-op let's call it, has a FLOW which, considered over any time period, consists of ORDERS, which have LINES where each line identifies a STOCK, a unit of handling, and a quantity;
* For the H-house, the functional requirements which must be satisfied are to "consume" the InFlow (inputs, raw materials, resources, etc.) and "produce" the OutFlow: It must have the capacity to UNLOAD and STORE INPUTS and ASSEMBLE and LOAD ORDERS as OUTPUTS for shipment (end of Warehouse metaphor);
* In any case, the attributes of INPUTS and OUTPUTS in the Historiothèque which are relevant for design decision making are: Physical attributes, Operational attributes, and Managerial attributes;
* In another section, we will be speaking of all of this as the "LOGISTICS OF THE HISTORIOTHÈQUE";

## WORKSPACE MANAGEMENT
* Temporary information:
  * The goal is to always be able to re-orient oneself after a *Work-Session*;
  * You leave *Breadcrumbs* so you can re-orient yourself each new *Workday*;
  * You need to master the art of *configuring a workspace*;
  * The *Workspace* is virtual and 4-dimensional, i.e. it is a 3-dimensional surface changing over time;
  * One needs to know the previous configuration and be able to reinstate that configuration;
  * You could call it the *Restoration of Previous Workstate*;

*06:00 2024-01-09*

* The most important thing in the kind of work of interdisciplinary art-research that I do is *not losing operational continuity*;
* This means that I always need to know *where I left off*, during my previous *work-session*;
* That's how one retains and maintains operational continuity, by knowing the previous *work-state* and *continuing in that vein*;
* This is the fundamental aspect of *Workspace Management*, i.e. the management of the virtual workspace so that you never lose continuity;
* When you go to bed at night, you leave the workspace behind and in the morning when you go back to work, you need to know *where you left off*;
* So you have to have some discipline in your work practices, you need to leave *a trail of breadcrumbs* that you can follow to come back to the fundamental *Workspace* you were in during your previous *work-session*;
* This means backing up all your data, all your current files, your logs and so forth;
* It also means documenting all your practices and making them accessible online;
* Everything needs to be accessible online so you can *work remotely*, never knowing if you are going to be at home or not when you need to keep working;
* All projects are saved and can be restored at any time;
* *In the workspace, in general, I always use timestamps and when I "leave off", I write what the last thing was that I was doing*;
* *In this way, I never lose track of what I'm doing, and I can reconstruct temporal orders of things based on my multiple log-files*;
* I basically only need to remember what the __*LAST THING*__ was that I was working on; the rest can be reconstructed from the timestamped materials;

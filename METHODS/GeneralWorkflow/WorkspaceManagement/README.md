## WORKSPACE MANAGEMENT
* Temporary information:
  * The goal is to always be able to re-orient oneself after a *Work-Session*;
  * You leave *Breadcrumbs* so you can re-orient yourself each new *Workday*;
  * You need to master the art of *configuring a workspace*;
  * The *Workspace* is virtual and 4-dimensional, i.e. it is a 3-dimensional surface changing over time;
  * One needs to know the previous configuration and be able to reinstate that configuration;
  * You could call it the *Restoration of Previous Workstate*;

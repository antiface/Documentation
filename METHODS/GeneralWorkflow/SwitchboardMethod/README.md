## THE SWITCHBOARD METHOD OF PROJECT-BASED, SERIAL ART PRODUCTION

*"Work Efficiency At The Speed of Thought"*

__*The Switchboard Method:*__
* Take __*n*__ number of tasks;
* Choose one task at a time, work on it for approximately 15 minutes, then __SWITCH TASKS__;
* Continue doing this continuously throughout the day, switching tasks every 5-10 or 15 minutes;
* Switch tasks __*pseudo-randomly*__, that is, choose whatever task is most __*immediate*__;
* Choose whatever tasks is most relevant to the given time;
* Choose tasks that are more __*ready-to-hand*__ either physically *proximate* or else *close* to you in your *cognitive space*, *emotional space*, your __*Fields of Experience*__ or __*Fields of Discourse*__;
* Act as though you were a __MECHANICAL TURK__ at Amazon;
* You will achieve more efficiency this way;
* Take an example. Say someone writes 1 novel in 1 notebook;
* Now you write 12 novels in 12 notebooks, except you use the __SWITCHBOARD METHOD__;
* The other person might finish their 1 novel in __*x amount of time*__;
* You will finish in __*x+y amount of time*__, __*y*__ being a constant;
* It will take you a little more time to write 12 novels across 12 notebooks instead of 1 across 1, but at the end of __*x+y time*__, you will have written __12 NOVELS INSTEAD OF 1__;
* The __SWITCHBOARD METHOD__ is essentially a __*NON-LINEAR METHOD OF WORK ORGANIZATION*__ and can provide *Great Efficiencies in Time* (awaiting *mathematical proof*);

* I am told this is the __*assignment problem*__ in theoretical computer science, but usually you have __n agents__ to whom you must assign __m number of tasks__;
* In my case, there are only __n tasks__ and __1 agent__;
* All that's really important here is the decision problem and efficient allocation of resources;
* You would normally look at costs and so forth, cost functions, etc.;
* Thats not my problem, though; I got rid of the decision problem and saved at least __1 bit__;
* It might not seem like a lot, yet computationally, with over __100 projects__ still actively running in my *Art Operation*, I needed to save *as many bits as possible*;
* I don't *decide* what task to work on; I tackle whatever is most __proximate/immediate/ready-to-hand__;
* It doesn't matter what it is,it will absolutely be an __enriching,learning experience__;
* Randomized task assignment just seems optimal to me; I'm able to maintain over 100 complex, interdisciplinary art-research projects, and I'm a __*One-Man Shop*__, a single art operator at the __*Art Operation @ The Historiotheque*__;
* More on this later; this is based on the research for a new project, and series of series, I started earlier in the year, called __*NOISE IN THE WORKSPACE*__;
* The first series was called __*SPACE NOISE INJECTION*__ and, you see, while the first series is still only beginning, I started the second series of experiments, called __*RANDOMIZED EXPERIMENTAL PARAMETERS*__;
* After just a few months, I have enough research and experimental data to write a PhD thesis in __interruption science__;

* One of the ways this *Method* works is by removing *waiting-times*;
* One does not spend any significant amount of times either *Deciding* what tasks to tackle __OR__ any significant amount of time *building up complex mental abstractions*, which software developers often have to do in the course of any given period of __*Deep Work*__;
* I merely look at the *Surface of the Workspace* and choose what is most *proximate/immediate*;
* This *literally* means looking around the __*Studio Space @ The Historiotheque*__ and choosing whatever is *nearest in time and space*;
* I realize that the *3D Surface of the Workspace* is where I get most of my new ideas, from actually *working in the Historioteque AND in the Archive*;
* It's where I came up with the concept of *Geogrammar or Geogrammatical Forms*, as __*floating land-masses*__, as portrayed in my novelistic phenomenology __*The History-Project*__ as __*Crackland, the Land of Fissures*__ and as __*Antiface-Cloud*__ in my sequel __*The Archives-Project*__;
* The so-called *land-masses* or *fragments* are really the __*exposed surfaces of the Stacks*__ (SEE: *The Stacks-Project*);
* Each of these "Stacks" are *built-up* over time as *sedimentary layers or through a sedimentation process*;
* I continuously *Survey* the top-post surfaces of these many *Stacks* and make *mental links* or __*REFCARDS*__ which I file in my *Inner Refcards-System*, my __*DATABASE-OF-IMAGES*__ (SEE: *Database Arts*);
* SEE: Images below, of the *3D Workspace as Abstract Cartography* (seen from above) and two diagrams of __*THE SWITCHBOARD METHOD*__ as well as one for *The Stacks-Project*;

* I also use __*THE SWITCHBOARD METHOD*__ in my __*RESEARCH PROCESS*__, since I am an interdisciplinary art-researcher;
* What I do here is I aim for __*COMPLETE UNDERSTANDING*__, not merely *passing understanding*;
* What I do is follow *my heart & soul*, I only read what is *most relevant* to my current, most fundamental experience of the world;
* For instance, I'm currently reading a book about the *topological foundations of painting* because it concords nicely with what I'm experiencing these days as a professional painter;
* But then, I also finished reading a short book by Sigmund Freud on *The Uncanny* (*"L'inquiétante étrangeté"*);
* I am maybe reading 20 books at the same time, and surprisingly I don't get lost, thanks both to my *prodigious memory* AND *my meticulous note-taking and organizing of learning materials or __reference materials or REFMATS__*;
* However, like in the rest of __*THE SWITCHBOARD METHOD*_, I rapidly oscillate between reading material, always following the __*DIRECTION AND PACE*__ of what's in *my heart & soul*;
* So for every page or less or at most 2-3 pages that I read, I stop and take ample notes, i.e. audio notes and physical notes (*Writing*) in notebooks or on *Index Cards* (SEE: __*REFCARDS*__);
* Then I introspect and self-reflect, contemplate, to make sure *I actually understand what I'm reading*;
* This can take anywhere from minutes, hours, days, to weeks, months, and even years;
* Some things that I was reading 20+ years ago, I'm only just beginning to understand __*TODAY*__; it takes *that long*;
* Anyhow, I rapidly oscillate from book to book, from website to website, and in my research online, I use a variation on the *Switchboard Method*;
* I do what I have elsewhere called a *WikiWalk*;
* That is to say, I open up a *web resource* and begin reading it, and I open up each new *relevant hyperlink* into a new tab in my web browser;
* When I have up to 20-30 tabs open in the browser, to save on *RAM*, I use a *browser extension* that *saves a list of all open tabs and collapses the tabs*;
* I then copy the list of tabs on my computer in a .txt file that acts as a __*LOG*__ and I also copy a version of it in a *Gist File* on GitHub's *Gist Service*;
* I then back up all my notes and logs in the cloud as well as on an *external hard-drive*;
* I do this continuously throughout the day, when I'm not working on art, i.e. painting and music and novel-writing;
* Do I ever take breaks? Of course, I do. I'm constantly taking breaks, every 5 or 10-15, 20 minutes tops;
* I find that I get much more done throughout the day when I do things this way;
* So to recap, while I'm reading books and web resources, PDFs and so forth, I'm constantly *switching* from one to the other;
* I'll open up a video, watch 5 minutes, then open up another video, watch 3 minutes, then search for someone's name online that was mentioned in a video, etc., etc.; you get the *gist*;
* I work very rapidly, *at the speed of thought*, constantly logging, documenting, taking notes, and publishing everything online in the manner of __*CONTINUOUS DELIVERY*__;
* [...]

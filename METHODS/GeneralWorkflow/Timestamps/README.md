### Timestamps
* Essentially, one consistently has to put down the time and date, essentially whenever one takes any action of any importance;
* One must take notes, and notes must always be timestamped;
* The reason is that one must be able to preserve the temporal order of things, for future reference;
* One never knows when one is going to have to go back in time and will require timestamps;
* Therefore, by including them as often as possible, or as often as feasible, we instantly mitigate the risk of losing the temporal order of things, now and forever;
* Whatever the format is of one's timestamps, whether they are written by hand on paper or index cards, or on a computer system such as in a text editor or whatnot, the most important thing is a) to include timestamps and b) to have consistency in format used over time;
* If one can, solve the format problem first and foremost, and then just use that format until you find something better, if ever that happens;
* (This, in passing, is true of almost everything in running an Art Operation: Do your best, use your best practices, your best knowledge and know-how, UNTIL SOMETHING BETTER COMES ALONG, then use that if it really is better. Although sometimes switching costs are prohibitive. Alas...);

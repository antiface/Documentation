### Timestamps
* Essentially, one consistently has to put down the time and date, essentially whenever one takes any action of any importance;
* One must take notes, and notes must always be timestamped;
* The reason is that one must be able to preserve the temporal order of things, for future reference;
* One never knows when one is going to have to go back in time and will require timestamps;
* Therefore, by including them as often as possible, or as often as feasible, we instantly mitigate the risk of losing the temporal order of things, now and forever;
* Whatever the format is of one's timestamps, whether they are written by hand on paper or index cards, or on a computer system such as in a text editor or whatnot, the most important thing is a) to include timestamps and b) to have consistency in format used over time;
* If one can, solve the format problem first and foremost, and then just use that format until you find something better, if ever that happens;
* (This, in passing, is true of almost everything in running an Art Operation: Do your best, use your best practices, your best knowledge and know-how, UNTIL SOMETHING BETTER COMES ALONG, then use that if it really is better. Although sometimes switching costs are prohibitive. Alas...).

### In an Notebook or on an Index Card
* As I said, one must put down the time and date whenever one takes some action;
* I also said "any action of any importance" because it's not always necessary to use a timestamp, in fact in certain unique special cases, it can be counterproductive or even a burden;
* If I am using a notebook, here is what I do: Whenever I decide to write something in the notebook, I start with a timestamp;
* I do this every time I write something in the notebook, not only when I start a new page;
* There are many reasons for this, one of which - perhaps the most profound! - is that if one's notebook at some future time ends up in a state of disrepair, or if pages accidentally get ripped out of the notebook, the great "redundancy" if you will of multiple timestamps on essentially every section of the notebook, will make it so that "reconstructing" the temporal order of events or the sequence of notes in the notebook will be much more RELIABLE (in the long-term);
* Simply put, the redundancy of multiple timestamps within pages means that the temporal order is much more ROBUST in the sense that it can more easily be put back together;
* I'm not sure that I expressed that adequately, but in any case I use the same method whether I am writing on looseleaf or else in a notebook or on an index card, or even on the computer in a text editor, or on the web. At least I try to do this;
* Another reason is that when everything is timestamped, it's much measier to then treat everything as part of a massive "LOGFILE";
* That is to say, my notebook becomes a LOG once I consistently add timestamps. Otherwise it's just a notebook;
* Sections can more easily be spoken of and treated as "atomic" units if you will;
* Therefore, this practice serves multiple important purposes all at once, simply by continuously adding timestamps on everything;
* Of course, one must not take it to absurd levels. For instance, if I am writing a good deal of material in my notebook, I will include a timestamp every now and then, at least at every new page, right at the top of the page. And even if I keep going, I might include another timestamp somewhere down the page, just for good measure;
* Ergo, except for a few rare cases, and categories of cases, one can basically just *USE TIMESTAMPS AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE!*

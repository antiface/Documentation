#METHODS
##Abridged Basic Daily Workflow
1. First thing, top of the morning, is to open up a new .txt file called "DAYPATH_CURRENTDATE.txt" which contains a rough outline of what I need to get done today;
2. Second, I start a "LOG_CURRENTDATE.txt" file where I will keep a running record of all of the web sites / web resources that I use in the course of the day;
3. I then open up my latest  "ConceptLog.txt" and latest "ProblemSolutionLog.txt" files;
    * a) The former contains a running record of all of the concepts and themes that I am currently working on/with in both my artistic practice AND my accompanying interdisciplinary research;
    * b) The latter contains a running record of #PROBLEMS that I encounter in my everyday life and work and their #SOLUTIONS;
4. I then can usually start working, going through my #DAYPATH file, item by item;
5. I also begin taking notes in various notebooks, I also do experiments in painting or sound design or whatnot and write "LabNotes" for those (which I post in a repository on Github as well as on a blog called "AntiLog");
6. Periodically, I print things out, Wikipedia articles or blog posts, essays and so forth (in PDF or other format). I am constantly printing stuff out - what I call "print-outs" - which I read and then file away in file folders in my filing cabinets (I have two filing cabinets next to my desk);
    * a) Each folder has a "start_date" and "end_date", and I try to stamp each of my print-outs with a timestamp, so I know in what order I printed and read them; (everything else goes in my various "LOG" files;
    * b) Eventually, file folders are retired to the filing cabinets;
    * c) Periodically, I go through old folders in the filing cabinets and I "compress" them, I call it. Simply put, I open the folder, go through it item by item, and I discard or throw out everything that either is not necessary to keep or else is something from Wikipedia or something that I can easily find on-line on some future date, should I ever need to;
    * d) I go through each item in the folder, writing down the Titles of every article in a new .txt file - or on an index card, or sheet of paper - which I then attach to the front cover of the folder. What this does is limit or constrain the SIZE of my personal archives. I constantly do this in the course of my work to ensure that my archives are "manageable". I call it a form of "history-compression" (it is a form of INDEX and/or simply Metadata ABOUT the contents (data) of a given file folder);
7. Also upon waking, I check my email and other messages and do a bit of monitoring of the news. I do these "clerical" activities, if you will, on a daily basis, throughout the course of the day, when I'm not too busy with other more important stuff;
8. I also have reading periods where as I said, I read my printed materials ("print-outs") as well as books that I have recently purchased or else am re-reading for purposes of reference; (I also read on the computer, PDFs and so forth, or on-line on my computer(s) or else on my tablet);
9. In any case, other than that, I am either painting or composing/playing/recording music (or doing sound design), or else I'm writing something, a novel I am working on or a philosophical essay, or just taking random notes of my thoughts and so forth (and my rants, which I keep a log of). I might work on a bibliography or else I'm tweeting things or posting things on-line, everything from sounds to images to texts;
10. Also, and in conclusion, I am constantly going over my various methods and "optimizing" them. I look at what's not working in the current state of the system and make corrections. I also have an archive of visual arts materials, art objects, that I maintain. I spend a lot of time "In The Archives" as I like to say, going over stuff, making sure everything is properly "bagged & tagged", making sure everything is findable and whatnot, organized, classified properly, etc. I also write code, mostly in Python, which takes a lot of my time, as does the various learning materials that I am consuming on-line, whether in the form of more formal "MOOCs" or else just videos, podcasts, etc. etc.

##NOTES & LOGS
* In general, I'm constantly taking notes, documenting my processes, procedures, methodologies. I have several notebooks going at any given time. One is always placed next to my desk. I take ample notes in this notebook whenever I am working at the computer, or in the "office" generally (I actually work in an office/art studio/recording studio, a workspace I call "The Historioth√®que". See: [Historiotheque] (https://github.com/antiface/Historiotheque));
* I also do a great deal of "logging" on the computer, and also in various notebooks reserved for that purpose;
* To give you an idea of what my various logging and related activities might look like on my computer, on the Desktop, here is what a folder/directory structure might look like. This isn't what I am using, it's just an example of a "Schema" I might use, to illustrate how everything that is important to me, and important enough to LOG, effectively gets LOGGED in various places in the directories. And so, for example, we might have:

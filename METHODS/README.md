#METHODS
##Abridged Basic Daily Workflow
1. First thing, top of the morning, is to open up a new .txt file called "DAYPATH_CURRENTDATE.txt" which contains a rough outline of what I need to get done today;
2. Second, I start a "LOG_CURRENTDATE.txt" file where I will keep a running record of all of the web sites / web resources that I use in the course of the day;
3. I then open up my latest  "ConceptLog.txt" and latest "ProblemSolutionLog.txt" files;
    i) The former contains a running record of all of the concepts and themes that I am currently working on/with in both my artistic practice AND my accompanying interdisciplinary research;
    i) The latter contains a running record of #PROBLEMS that I encounter in my everyday life and work and their #SOLUTIONS;
4. I then can usually start working, going through my #DAYPATH file, item by item;
5. I also begin taking notes in various notebooks, I also do experiments in painting or sound design or whatnot and write "LabNotes" for those (which I post in a repository on Github as well as on a blog called "AntiLog";
6. Periodically, I print things out, Wikipedia articles or blog posts, essays and so forth (in PDF or other format). I am constantly printing stuff out - what I call "print-outs" - which I read and then file away in file folders in my filing cabinets (I have two filing cabinets next to my desk);
    i) Each folder has a "start_date" and "end_date", and I try to stamp each of my print-outs with a timestamp, so I know in what order I printed and read them; (everything else goes in my various "LOG" files;
    ii) Eventually, file folders are retired to the filing cabinets;
    iii) Periodically, I go through old folders in the filing cabinets and I "compress" them, I call it. Simply put, I open the folder, go through it item by item, and I discard or throw out everything that either is not necessary to keep or else is something from Wikipedia or something that I can easily find on-line on some future date, should I ever need to;
    iv) I go through each item in the folder, writing down the Titles of every article in a new .txt file - or on an index card, or sheet of paper - which I then attach to the front cover of the folder. What this does is limit or constrain the SIZE of my personal archives. I constantly do this in the course of my work to ensure that my archives are "manageable". I call it a form of "history-compression" (it is a form of Metadata ABOUT the contents (data) of a given file folder);
7. Also upon waking, I check my email and other messages and do a bit of monitoring of the news. I do these "clerical" activities, if you will, on a daily basis, throughout the course of the day, when I'm not too busy with other more important stuff;
8. I also have reading periods where as I said, I read my printed materials ("print-outs") as well as books that I have recently purchased or else am re-reading for purposes of reference; (I also read on the computer, PDFs and so forth, or on-line on my computer(s) or else on my tablet).

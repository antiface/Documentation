### The Stacks-Project
* Experiments in archival science with physical sorting algorithms;
* See: The Datatypes Project:
  * [The Datatypes Project: Abstract Assembly](http://datatypes.tumblr.com/);
  * [DataTypes](https://github.com/antiface/DataTypes);
* *The Stacks-Project* was an idea I started many years ago that came from my daily art-research practice, where I am constantly manipulating *Stacks* of books, folders, papers, index cards, etc.;
* It also came out of *The Datatypes Project*, mentioned above, where I wanted to take basic data types and data structures in theoretical computer science and programming and find *analogies* for them in everyday life;
* The *Stack abstract data type* became a kind of metaphor for what I was already doing in my daily work, especially when I do *archival work*, where I *Sort* through large amounts of *archival materials*;
* I didn't set out to become an *archivist* and in many ways, I want to STOP being an archivist and work of [*Dismantling The Archive*](https://medium.com/the-painters-almanach/dismantling-the-archive-791746be03f0) as I am now calling it;

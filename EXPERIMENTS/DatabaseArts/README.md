### DATABASE ARTS / TACTICAL MEDIA
- The Database Genre
  - New Media Objects: They appear as collections of items on which the user can perform various operations: View, Navigate, Search.
  - Ervin Panofsky => Linear perspective as "symbolic form" of the modern age.
  - The world now appears to us as an endless and unstructured collection of images, texts, and other data records.
  - Hence, we model it as a database.
  - [Pool of Data]
  - Traditional genre which already had a database-like structure, such as photo-the album
  - as defined by original HTML, a web page is a sequential list of separate elements: Text blocks, images, digital video clips, and links to other pages.
  - Database Genre: Bibliography.
  - Lists of Elements
- The Anti-Narrative Logic of the Web
  - If new elements are being added over time, the result is a collection, not a story.
  - Algorithm: Logic of computer game, execution  of tasks in order to win => The world is reduced to two kinds of software objects which are complementary to each other: Data structures and algorithms.
  - Cultural algorithm: reality => media => data => database.
  - The work as interface.
  - A particular choice made within a hyper-narrative.
  - "Strange Objects" => ambiguous signs / obscure signs (as in Writing-Without-Writing)
  - Classification art / Schema art => (Reading-Without-Reading)
  - Arbitrary sequence of elements => not a narrative
  - Post-Narrative / Post-Conversation
  - Post-Conversation: Loosely connected, loosely coupled statements => Not a Discourse
  - Media theory => what is NOT being said.
- Serial Method
  - Time-Series
  - List of Elements: Database Art

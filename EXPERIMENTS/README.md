### BASICS OF EXPERIMENTAL METHODOLOGY
- First and foremost, "EXPERIMENTS" herein are conceived of and designed within the scope of FIELD ART and ART OPERATIONS in the laboratory called THE HISTORIOTHEQUE;
- Secondly, "EXPERIMENTS" are ALWAYS held within the confines, and various contexts, of THE HISTORIOTHEQUE, as LABORATORY;
- Thirdly, SAFETY/SECURITY in ALL EXPERIMENTS is always the number one CONSTRAINT; no experiment is undertaken or even conceived if it has certain unacceptable RISKS, such as risks to HEALTH of humans or animals, risks of NOISE POLLUTION, risks of POLLUTION in general, and many other like risks; NO ACTION IS UNDERTAKEN WITH EVEN REMOTELY POSSIBLE UNACCEPTABLE RISKS;
- Fourthly, certain risks CAN be taken, but never without proper comprehensive development of risk management and risk mitigation, and other related forms of ensuring that no "acceptable" risks accidentally turn into "unacceptable" risks;
  - i.e. no illicit substances are utilized, nothing even remotely resembling a weapon, no potentially dangerous tools are used other than in their prescribed usage within only certain constrained, specified usages within acceptable ART TECHNIQUES;
  - i.e. SCISSORS and other sharp objects are often necessary; SCISSORS are for cutting paper or cardboard, or pieces of masking tape; certain KNIVES or BLADES are often used, to cut cardboard and like things, ALWAYS using necessary precautions, i.e. a CUTTING-BOARD, etc.;
  - Some art materials are notoriously toxic, oil and acrylic paints are known toxic materials, so ADEQUATE VENTILATION is always PRESCRIBED, and OBSERVED; and no "WET" surfaces, of paint or glue or other potentially toxic, yet widely-accepted and often necessary materials are left to "DRY" in conditions or environments or places where they could negatively affect the health of any human OR animal; ALSO: such materials are ALWAYS carefully disposed of, i.e. if any WASTE MATERIALS contain PAINT or GLUE or any otherwise toxic or potentially toxic materials, their disposal follows all local laws and by-laws; ALL PAPER AND CARDBOARD AND OTHER SCRAPS OR WASTE PRODUCTS THAT ARE DEEMED "RECYCLABLE", BY LOCAL STANDARDS, ARE RECYCLED; NO "BIOLOGICAL MATERIALS" ARE EVER USED IN ANY EXPERIMENT OR PROCESS WITHIN THE CONFINES OF THE LABORATORY KNOWN AS THE HISTORIOTHEQUE, i.e. foodstuffs are not put into works of painting, all surfaces are carefully cleaned at all times to avoid the possibility of contamination from foodstuffs or other biological materials, if necessary surfaces, both working surfaces, i.e. "WORKSPACES", and surfaces worked on, i.e. "CANVASES" or other SUPPORTS for painting, are always cleaned, sanitized, decontaminated, using only acceptable means; IF SURFACES ARE CLEANED WITH CLEANING AGENTS THAT COULD INVOLVE RISKS OF POISONING OR OTHER RELATED RISKS, THEY ARE ALWAYS USED APPROPRIATELY, ACCORDING TO THE BEST PRACTICES AND BEST-KNOWN, AND HIGHEST STANDARDS; SURFACES DISINFECTED WITH POTENTIALLY HAZARDOUS CLEANING AGENTS ARE WASHED WITH WATER OR OTHER NON-TOXIC AGENT TO ENSURE NO POTENTIALLY HARMFUL "RESIDUES" ARE LEFT BEHIND;
  - Otherwise, ALL NECESSARY MEASURES are taken to ensure the safety, security, and viability of the premises;

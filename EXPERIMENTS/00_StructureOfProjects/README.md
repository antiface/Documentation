### Documentation / EXPERIMENTS / Structure of Projects
* Basic structure of Projects;
* Each Project is essentially, implicitly an ARCHIVE;
* Starting a new Project is like opening a new file folder or dossier;
* Each new Project is structured in the same way;
* The Project is structured hierarchically, from general to specific, from top to bottom as:
  * A FONDS OR COLLECTION;
    * with possibility of SOUS-FONDS;
  * A SERIES;
    * with possibility of SUB-SERIES;
  * A FILE;
  * AN ITEM;
* The Archive often includes its own FINDING AIDS, whether it is in the format of a CONTENT LIST or other such navigational device;
* That is to say, the Project IS an Archive, The Project IS a Fonds or Collection;
* Each Project/Archive/Collection HAS SERIES, is made up of SERIES;
* The Series are made up of Documents which can take many forms, i.e. the form of Images, Texts, Sounds, and other Types/Structures;
* Essentially, each Type (type of ITEM) in a File, in a Series (or Subseries) is treated as a DATA TYPE;
* For example, a Painting is an Image, and takes the data type of a kind of ARRAY or MATRIX, i.e. it is a two-dimensional "array structure" at least in its idealized, generalized form;
* One of the goals of this methodology is to FORMALIZE art production processes in the creation of the concept of ART OPERATIONS;
* The Art Operation is being formalized so that it can eventually be run with full autonomy, without human supervision, as a kind of distributed-autonomous corporation, in a formalized, distributed-autonomous ART MARKET (SEE: ART-OPS-IN-A-BOX CONCEPT);
* PROJECT also includes INTERNALS (internal logic) and DOCUMENTATION (of METHODS, GENERAL WORKFLOW, SERIES, EXPERIMENTS);

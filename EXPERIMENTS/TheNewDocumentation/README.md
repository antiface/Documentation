# THE NEW DOCUMENTATION

*PREAMBLE*
- I am thinking of a New Documentation for software projects, but applied specifically to contemporary, interdisciplinary art-research practices;
- I think that a software project, if it is truly open source, has to be "accessible" to non-experts;
- It is more and more true today, and will be even more true in the future, that source code is being "read" by non-experts, by non-programmers, non-coders;
- That is to say, more and more, code is not only being handled by the "experts", the engineers and so forth;
- What happens is that more and more people are having to work with code sets;
- For example, more and more companies today are essentially software companies;
- Software is touching everything today, and it will only trend upwards in coming years and decades;
- So what you have is that in any given company that you might be working in, there will likely be source code, a code base of some sort;
- And even if you are just a manager or whatnot, an individual with no expertise in actual coding/programming, you are still increasingly likely to be interacting with code created by your company;
- And so you may need to actually LOOK at the code itself;
- That is what the New Documentation is, in part;
  - It means adding annotations or comments, or just plain documentation designed for non-technical-experts;
  - As stated above, individuals working in companies across countless industries will increasingly have to deal with engineers, programmers, and their code bases;
  - A manager, for instance, cannot truly do his/her work if the code and the engineers' work is in a "black box" somewhere, untouchable;
- Ergo, one needs to make source code READABLE TO NON-EXPERTS;
- I plan to develop these concepts further, drawing from my expertise in discourse analysis, content analysis, and literary theory / critical theory, and philosophy of course;
- In philosophy, for instance, one deals with very complex textual structures, texts that have many layers, that are complex in structure;
- Software/code in essence IS only Yet Another Form of Text;
- Code = Text, and so code itself, source code, needs to be studied as texts and other documents are studied in other fields;
- Essentially, since the birth of writing in the Sumerian cuneiform clay tablets, until today in our virtual machines and so forth, tables have been extremely important in the entire history of civilization;
- Writing is Writing is Writing; CODE = TEXT; PERIOD!
- And so as there are GENRES in literary theory, there are GENRES IN CODE, in source code, there are GENRES OF APPLICATION//APPLICATION GENRES;
- I believe that one must study source code as a literary GENRE, and there are many subgenres of CODE;
- We only need to develop adequate and proper ways of DOCUMENTING CODE to reflect these new realities.

"The New Documentation" represents a significant departure from the traditional notion of the "artist's mystique" and the practice of keeping artistic processes shrouded in secrecy. In earlier art movements, particularly in modern art, there was often a deliberate effort by artists to cultivate an aura of mystery around their work and personas. This mystique served to elevate the artist to a status of enigma, with their creations viewed as transcendent expressions of genius. Additionally, artists often guarded their techniques and methodologies as closely held "trade secrets," motivated by concerns over trademark, copyright, and maintaining a competitive edge in the art market.

However, "The New Documentation" challenges these conventions by advocating for transparency, collaboration, and open sharing of artistic processes. By embracing principles akin to those found in the realm of open source software development, it heralds the emergence of the "Open Source Artist." Here are some connections between contemporary, interdisciplinary art-research practices and similar practices in independent software development:

1. __Transparency and Collaboration__:
- Like in open source software development, where code is openly shared and collaboratively developed, "The New Documentation" encourages artists to document their processes transparently and share them with the public. This fosters collaboration, knowledge exchange, and collective learning within the artistic community.
2. __Democratization of Creativity__:
- Just as open source software democratizes access to technology by allowing anyone to contribute and modify code, "The New Documentation" democratizes access to artistic processes. It breaks down barriers to participation in the arts, allowing aspiring artists and enthusiasts to learn from and contribute to the creative process.
3. __Iterative Development__:
- In both contexts, there is a recognition of the value of iterative development. Artists, like software developers, can benefit from continuously refining and improving their work based on feedback from peers and the community. Version control systems, commonly used in software development, can also facilitate tracking changes and documenting revisions in artistic projects.
4. __Community Building__:
- Open source software projects often foster vibrant communities of contributors and users who collaborate, share knowledge, and support one another. Similarly, "The New Documentation" promotes community building within the artistic realm, encouraging dialogue, critique, and mutual support among artists, researchers, and enthusiasts.
5. __Intellectual Property Considerations__:
- While open source software operates within legal frameworks such as licenses (e.g., GPL, MIT), "The New Documentation" addresses intellectual property considerations in art, such as copyright and attribution. By openly documenting their processes, artists can still assert their rights over their creations while enabling others to learn from and build upon their work.

Overall, "The New Documentation" represents a paradigm shift in artistic practice, embracing openness, collaboration, and the democratization of creativity.

# THE NEW DOCUMENTATION

*PREAMBLE*
- I am thinking of a New Documentation for software projects, but applied specifically to contemporary, interdisciplinary art-research practices;
- I think that a software project, if it is truly open source, has to be "accessible" to non-experts;
- It is more and more true today, and will be even more true in the future, that source code is being "read" by non-experts, by non-programmers, non-coders;
- That is to say, more and more, code is not only being handled by the "experts", the engineers and so forth;
- What happens is that more and more people are having to work with code sets;
- For example, more and more companies today are essentially software companies;
- Software is touching everything today, and it will only trend upwards in coming years and decades;
- So what you have is that in any given company that you might be working in, there will likely be source code, a code base of some sort;
- And even if you are just a manager or whatnot, an individual with no expertise in actual coding/programming, you are still increasingly likely to be interacting with code created by your company;
- And so you may need to actually LOOK at the code itself;
- That is what the New Documentation is, in part;
  - It means adding annotations or comments, or just plain documentation designed for non-technical-experts;
  - As stated above, individuals working in companies across countless industries will increasingly have to deal with engineers, programmers, and their code bases;
  - A manager, for instance, cannot truly do his/her work if the code and the engineers' work is in a "black box" somewhere, untouchable;
- Ergo, one needs to make source code READABLE TO NON-EXPERTS;
- I plan to develop these concepts further, drawing from my expertise in discourse analysis, content analysis, and literary theory / critical theory, and philosophy of course;
- In philosophy, for instance, one deals with very complex textual structures, texts that have many layers, that are complex in structure;
- Software/code in essence IS only Yet Another Form of Text;
- Code = Text, and so code itself, source code, needs to be studied as texts and other documents are studied in other fields;
- Essentially, since the birth of writing in the Sumerian cuneiform clay tablets, until today in our virtual machines and so forth, tables have been extremely important in the entire history of civilization;
- Writing is Writing is Writing; CODE = TEXT; PERIOD!
- And so as there are GENRES in literary theory, there are GENRES IN CODE, in source code, there are GENRES OF APPLICATION//APPLICATION GENRES;
- I believe that one must study source code as a literary GENRE, and there are many subgenres of CODE;
- We only need to develop adequate and proper ways of DOCUMENTING CODE to reflect these new realities.

"The New Documentation" represents a significant departure from the traditional notion of the "artist's mystique" and the practice of keeping artistic processes shrouded in secrecy. In earlier art movements, particularly in modern art, there was often a deliberate effort by artists to cultivate an aura of mystery around their work and personas. This mystique served to elevate the artist to a status of enigma, with their creations viewed as transcendent expressions of genius. Additionally, artists often guarded their techniques and methodologies as closely held "trade secrets," motivated by concerns over trademark, copyright, and maintaining a competitive edge in the art market.

However, "The New Documentation" challenges these conventions by advocating for transparency, collaboration, and open sharing of artistic processes. By embracing principles akin to those found in the realm of open source software development, it heralds the emergence of the "Open Source Artist." Here are some connections between contemporary, interdisciplinary art-research practices and similar practices in independent software development:

1. __Transparency and Collaboration__:
- Like in open source software development, where code is openly shared and collaboratively developed, "The New Documentation" encourages artists to document their processes transparently and share them with the public. This fosters collaboration, knowledge exchange, and collective learning within the artistic community.
2. __Democratization of Creativity__:
- Just as open source software democratizes access to technology by allowing anyone to contribute and modify code, "The New Documentation" democratizes access to artistic processes. It breaks down barriers to participation in the arts, allowing aspiring artists and enthusiasts to learn from and contribute to the creative process.
3. __Iterative Development__:
- In both contexts, there is a recognition of the value of iterative development. Artists, like software developers, can benefit from continuously refining and improving their work based on feedback from peers and the community. Version control systems, commonly used in software development, can also facilitate tracking changes and documenting revisions in artistic projects.
4. __Community Building__:
- Open source software projects often foster vibrant communities of contributors and users who collaborate, share knowledge, and support one another. Similarly, "The New Documentation" promotes community building within the artistic realm, encouraging dialogue, critique, and mutual support among artists, researchers, and enthusiasts.
5. __Intellectual Property Considerations__:
- While open source software operates within legal frameworks such as licenses (e.g., GPL, MIT), "The New Documentation" addresses intellectual property considerations in art, such as copyright and attribution. By openly documenting their processes, artists can still assert their rights over their creations while enabling others to learn from and build upon their work.

Overall, "The New Documentation" represents a paradigm shift in artistic practice, embracing openness, collaboration, and the democratization of creativity. By drawing parallels with practices in independent software development, it underscores the transformative potential of applying open source principles to the realm of art and research.

__The New Documentation for Art-Research Projects: A Paradigm Shift in Interdisciplinary Practice__

1. __Introduction__:
- In contemporary art-research projects, the concept of "The New Documentation" proposes a transformative approach to documenting and disseminating creative processes. Drawing inspiration from software development practices, it emphasizes accessibility, transparency, and interdisciplinary collaboration.
2. __Accessibility to Non-Experts__:
- Similar to open source software projects, art-research endeavors should strive to be accessible to individuals beyond the realm of artistic expertise. As art intersects with diverse fields and industries, more stakeholders, including managers and non-artists, may need to engage with artistic processes. The New Documentation advocates for annotations, comments, and plain documentation tailored for non-technical experts, facilitating understanding and collaboration across disciplines.
3. __Interdisciplinary Engagement__:
- In an era where art and technology converge, interdisciplinary collaboration is becoming increasingly prevalent. Just as individuals from various backgrounds interact with software code, stakeholders in art-research projects, spanning industries and disciplines, may find themselves engaging with artistic documentation. The New Documentation promotes interdisciplinary dialogue and collaboration, fostering a culture of cross-pollination and innovation.
4. __Code as Text__:
- Echoing principles from literary theory and critical discourse analysis, The New Documentation views artistic creations as textual structures with layers of meaning and complexity. Just as texts in philosophy and literature are subject to analysis, source code in art-research projects is regarded as a form of text. By recognizing code as text, artists and researchers can apply methodologies from literary theory to understand and interpret the nuances of their creative endeavors.
5. __Genres in Artistic Practice__:
- Analogous to genres in literary theory, there exist genres within artistic practice, each characterized by unique aesthetics, techniques, and conceptual frameworks. Whether it's visual arts, performance art, digital art, or multimedia installations, each genre represents a distinct mode of expression within the broader spectrum of art-research projects. The New Documentation encourages artists and researchers to explore and document these genres, facilitating deeper insights and understanding within the artistic community.
6. __Documentation for Reflecting Artistic Genres__:
- To effectively document artistic genres and creative processes, it's essential to develop appropriate and comprehensive documentation practices. This includes not only technical documentation but also contextual narratives, conceptual frameworks, and critical reflections. By documenting artistic genres in a manner that reflects their complexities and nuances, artists and researchers can enrich the discourse surrounding their work and invite broader engagement from diverse audiences.
7. __Conclusio__n:

"The New Documentation" heralds a new era of interdisciplinary art-research practice, characterized by accessibility, transparency, and collaboration. By applying principles from software development and literary theory, artists and researchers can redefine the documentation of creative processes, fostering deeper understanding, interdisciplinary dialogue, and innovation within the realm of contemporary art.

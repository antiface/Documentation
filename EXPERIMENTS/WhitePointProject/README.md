### THE WHITE POINT PROJECT

Experiment: White Point Project Experiments in Infinitesimal Pink

Statement of Purpose: Trying to study how light pink acrylic paint dries on cardboard.

Procedure: I watered down some pinkish paint and painted it on the cardboard sample. I let it dry standing up so that the paint would run. I am studying to see how it dries. I will add a thin layer of even more infinitesimally pink acrylic washes.

Notes: So far so good. Not much to say.

Experiment: White Point Project, Deconstruction of Pink and Yellow In Daylight Series

Statement of Purpose: Adding incremental very thin layers of infinitesimally white colors to originally Infinitesimal Pink

Procedure: I added infinitesimal yellow. The pink had already darkened, added to the color of the cardboard, I suppose, which is light brown. Added yellow-white wash, very thin, watered down. Observing results. Drying standing up again, but upside down this time to not show too much orientation information when displaying or scanning, digitally visualizing painting.

Notes: It's not so bad. The pinkish hue darkened when it dried, this surprised me. The yellow-white wash will have almost no visual effect on the production piece. It will just give it a soft "chalk" feel.

Experiment: WHITEPOINT PROJECT: Incremental Offwhite Series

Statement of Purpose: Introducing Pinkish White Wash, Then Yellow-White, Then Blueish-White Wash, in thin liquid layers, the washes add up to a Series, in theory the Daylight Series, since those are the hues I am using.

Procedure: Decompose the Daylight Series. Take hues from there, add them in thin layers to generate/compose COMPLEX COLORS.. Study the effects of the paint drying on the cardboard... Does the cardboard begin to behave differently after many watery layers?

Notes: I now have three layers and it is almost perfectly WHITE... infinitesimally OFFWHITE, which is the whole point of the WHITEPOINT PROJECT. So so far, in three layers, it is an ultimate success!

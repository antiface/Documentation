Experiment: Procedural Textures #001

Statement of Purpose: I am testing the hypothesis that it is Patina, the ageing factor in physical materials / material culture, which gives such value to art objects, long after they have passed their time.

Procedure: I made at least three paintings. I put paint on the canvas and let it dry a little (Primer) and then while it was drying, I pressed some paper towel on the surface and removed it strategically, to leave the imprint of the pattern of the weave on the paper towel. I also made one where I scraped a good deal and even made fine cuts with the palette knife.

Notes: I was trying to emulate old painted surfaces. You know when the paint is old and flaking? I wanted it to look like a basement floor made of old cement that's falling apart, with paint coming off like it was out of style. I use methods of "pressing" different textures ONTO the drying canvas, to leave IMPRINTS, a.k.a. "MARKS", "TRACES", "FOOTPRINTS". I believe that there is something ancient and sacred about PATINA that few humans today fully understand, if any at all. I think that that was the concept of History all alone, the Figure(s) of History. It was in the Elements that turn all solid things into thin air. The difference now is I am informed AND experimenting like a wild man. I just need to get this documentation strategy down pat. I told them, a mature art practise is 1% art and 99% book-keeping. They didn't believe me, but they should have.

Experiment: Documentation Practise #002

Statement of Purpose: I have been seeking ways of optimizing my everyday documentation practise, of record-keeping and so forth. It is my contention, and it goes without saying, that documentation is not only critically important, but it not exactly taught in school. In other words, it's much harder than one might think. Any progress is good progress, though, as we shall see.

Procedure: The procedure I went through is that on ZENODO.ORG I switched on one of my Github repositories called Art-Ops-in-a-Box, and got my very own DOI badge that I quickly added to the README.md on the repository. I have been experimenting with these kinds of digital research methodologies. I also posted on my blog ANTILOG where I am "narrating my work" throughout the day, as I do it. The procedure in this case was to "consolidate" months, no, YEARS of work. Documentation is the place where I put it all together.

Notes: One has to keep an archive when one is a contemporary art practitioner. One cannot merely pretend that memory, physical memory, doesn't matter. We all have forms of physical memory around us. I call them "Analog Databases". It's best to be organized. As you will see, more and more people will be suffering from "information overload". People discover or find content and then immediately forget where they found it, or where they stored it, IF they even stored it anywhere. It's our Global "Documentary Heritage" that hangs in the balance. It's important that we properly document our work. Otherwise, people might not be able to reproduce it, and the greater our work is, the more necessary its proper documentation becomes. It's about reproducibility, falsifiability, but also it's a question of ethics. It's harder than I thought, but it is well worth all the effort and hardship.

Experiment: Evolutionary Design #003

Statement of Purpose: What I've been trying to do is show the viability of a precise procedural methodology of designing images (programmatically). I have been doing it semi-manually, but want to prove (proof of concept) that it can be done programmatically, algorithmically, in a few steps. That is, visual "interestingness" is created in as few steps as possible, starting from a pure noise signal (procedural noise function).

Procedure: What I do is begin with the best statistical noise I can find. I often use the ANU Quantum Numbers Server on-line, or else I just use primitive noise functions to generate procedural noise. Once I have my noise signal, I begin to "modulate" it, by using other primitive functions. The idea is that, ideally, I only use the most primitive image processing operations, functions. That way, a computer coule easily do what I do, follow this precise procedural design methodology. The idea is to get rid of me entirely. So what I do is take a copy of the procedural noise and create a second layer. I then use an operation like "pointillize" and merge the layers, with some transparency. I then paste another layer of the original noise signal and do a "pixelate" operation on that, then merge leaving transparency. The result is visually "interesting" and was done in a very small number of steps, beginning with a pure procedural noise function.

Notes: What I'm trying to get at is my Noise Field Theory. The first point I want to make is that the pure procedural noise function I begin with, is essentially a "random matrix". In the last case, of the one I just made and posted about on Medium, I really did use a 256 pixel by 256 pixel matrix of random black and white pixels, generated by the ANU Quantum Numbers Server on-line. You can't get more statistically "random" than that, at least I can't. The idea after that is just to "iterate", to modulate the noise signal in small ways in as few a number of steps as possible, to come up with something visually "arresting", i.e. which possesses or exhibits visual "interestingness". These trials are still early stage in the research. I will be doing many more of these. What I am concentrated on now is doing a proper proof of concept. I want to prove to the open scholarship community out there that this is a viable evolutionary design methodology. Not merely because I say so, but because it is based on the soundest and most viable methods of procedural texture generation.

Experiment: Procedural Textures #001

Statement of Purpose: I am testing the hypothesis that it is Patina, the ageing factor in physical materials / material culture, which gives such value to art objects, long after they have passed their time.

Procedure: I made at least three paintings. I put paint on the canvas and let it dry a little (Primer) and then while it was drying, I pressed some paper towel on the surface and removed it strategically, to leave the imprint of the pattern of the weave on the paper towel. I also made one where I scraped a good deal and even made fine cuts with the palette knife.

Notes: I was trying to emulate old painted surfaces. You know when the paint is old and flaking? I wanted it to look like a basement floor made of old cement that's falling apart, with paint coming off like it was out of style. I use methods of "pressing" different textures ONTO the drying canvas, to leave IMPRINTS, a.k.a. "MARKS", "TRACES", "FOOTPRINTS". I believe that there is something ancient and sacred about PATINA that few humans today fully understand, if any at all. I think that that was the concept of History all alone, the Figure(s) of History. It was in the Elements that turn all solid things into thin air. The difference now is I am informed AND experimenting like a wild man. I just need to get this documentation strategy down pat. I told them, a mature art practise is 1% art and 99% book-keeping. They didn't believe me, but they should have.

Experiment: Documentation Practise #002

Statement of Purpose: I have been seeking ways of optimizing my everyday documentation practise, of record-keeping and so forth. It is my contention, and it goes without saying, that documentation is not only critically important, but it not exactly taught in school. In other words, it's much harder than one might think. Any progress is good progress, though, as we shall see.

Procedure: The procedure I went through is that on ZENODO.ORG I switched on one of my Github repositories called Art-Ops-in-a-Box, and got my very own DOI badge that I quickly added to the README.md on the repository. I have been experimenting with these kinds of digital research methodologies. I also posted on my blog ANTILOG where I am "narrating my work" throughout the day, as I do it. The procedure in this case was to "consolidate" months, no, YEARS of work. Documentation is the place where I put it all together.

Notes: One has to keep an archive when one is a contemporary art practitioner. One cannot merely pretend that memory, physical memory, doesn't matter. We all have forms of physical memory around us. I call them "Analog Databases". It's best to be organized. As you will see, more and more people will be suffering from "information overload". People discover or find content and then immediately forget where they found it, or where they stored it, IF they even stored it anywhere. It's our Global "Documentary Heritage" that hangs in the balance. It's important that we properly document our work. Otherwise, people might not be able to reproduce it, and the greater our work is, the more necessary its proper documentation becomes. It's about reproducibility, falsifiability, but also it's a question of ethics. It's harder than I thought, but it is well worth all the effort and hardship.

Experiment: Evolutionary Design #003

Statement of Purpose: What I've been trying to do is show the viability of a precise procedural methodology of designing images (programmatically). I have been doing it semi-manually, but want to prove (proof of concept) that it can be done programmatically, algorithmically, in a few steps. That is, visual "interestingness" is created in as few steps as possible, starting from a pure noise signal (procedural noise function).

Procedure: What I do is begin with the best statistical noise I can find. I often use the ANU Quantum Numbers Server on-line, or else I just use primitive noise functions to generate procedural noise. Once I have my noise signal, I begin to "modulate" it, by using other primitive functions. The idea is that, ideally, I only use the most primitive image processing operations, functions. That way, a computer coule easily do what I do, follow this precise procedural design methodology. The idea is to get rid of me entirely. So what I do is take a copy of the procedural noise and create a second layer. I then use an operation like "pointillize" and merge the layers, with some transparency. I then paste another layer of the original noise signal and do a "pixelate" operation on that, then merge leaving transparency. The result is visually "interesting" and was done in a very small number of steps, beginning with a pure procedural noise function.

Notes: What I'm trying to get at is my Noise Field Theory. The first point I want to make is that the pure procedural noise function I begin with, is essentially a "random matrix". In the last case, of the one I just made and posted about on Medium, I really did use a 256 pixel by 256 pixel matrix of random black and white pixels, generated by the ANU Quantum Numbers Server on-line. You can't get more statistically "random" than that, at least I can't. The idea after that is just to "iterate", to modulate the noise signal in small ways in as few a number of steps as possible, to come up with something visually "arresting", i.e. which possesses or exhibits visual "interestingness". These trials are still early stage in the research. I will be doing many more of these. What I am concentrated on now is doing a proper proof of concept. I want to prove to the open scholarship community out there that this is a viable evolutionary design methodology. Not merely because I say so, but because it is based on the soundest and most viable methods of procedural texture generation.

Experiment: Evolutionary Art / Generative Art / Iterated Design Methodology #004

Statement of Purpose: I have been modifying my evolutionary art methodology, trying to make it as close to something a computer or algorithm can do as possible. The current hypothesis is that it is HARD to make a computer create interesting art, but that it is also POSSIBLE. Just general workmanship here. Furthering the ideas.

Procedure: What I did is that I tried to ONLY USE THE PIXELATE OPERATION. I made large squares on one layer and smaller squares on another layer. I then used the "DIFFERENCE" setting on the layers, so that the resulting image would be the "DIFFERENCE" of the two. I had basically good results, but I want to take it much further.

Notes: It's hard to make computers create art! But it's possible, and it's not only possible, it's worth every second of it. I create layers and then use difference functions on the layers. It's the quickest, simplest way I have found thus far for creating visual "interestingness". I need my images to be "arresting". I want people to take a second look. It's easy to create image, but hard to create GOOD IMAGES, even harder when you are trying to do it PROCEDURALLY. The idea is that I keep starting with pure Gaussian noise. I want a maximum of RANDOMNESS in the opening "seed" image/signal. After that, I try to use only the most PRIMITIVE FUNCTIONS/OPERATIONS. It's difficult because I'm struggling to find the proper mathematical formulae for doing this stuff. It would be easier if I already had all the math lined up, but I don't, so it's a bit hard. Ideally I need the algorithm to calculate things, compute things "numerically". That means that I can create "random matrices" at the outset and then "modulate" then algorithmically, programmatically. I'm making progress but it remains a HARD PROBLEM.

Experiment: Scaling Pixel Tricks #005

Statement of Purpose: I wanted to see if I could use noisy signals in 64 pixel by 64 pixel format, then resize the image to 128 pixels squared, while doing modifications, etc. The point being, using scaling as a tool to make noise make visually interesting effects.

Procedure: I started with an image of 64 pixels squared. I generated white Gaussian noise. I then resized the image to 128 pixels square, and added a layer of Gaussian noise, which I XORed, using the "DIFFERENCE" operation for layers. I then did the same thing for 256 pixels squared, then 512 pixels squared.

Notes: I got some pretty amazing results. I ended up with noisy images at the 512 pixels squared scale that were really, really rich in color and texture. The goal here is always to create visually interesting stuff. It doesn't really matter how I get to the ends, by which means. The important thing is that I get the effect I want. After that, THEN I can start to see how I can simplify the steps, the number of steps also, to try to get something genuinely "programmatic" or "algorithmic". So far I am getting really good results, though, so I need to continue in this direction, definitely.

Experiment: Textures Experiment #006

Statement of Purpose: The purpose of this experiment was to play with painterly textures in acrylic paint.

Procedure: I painted on canvas in acrylic paint, on roughly an 8 inch by 10 inch. I dripped liquidy paint on the canvas which was sitting flat on my banquet table. I let it partially dry, then removed most of the liquidy paint by doing compresses with paper towel (paper towel with a distinct pattern woven into it).

Notes: The result was pretty nice. You get LOTS of color, but totally SUBDUED, the way I often like it. It would be perfect for doing a portrait on top of it in pencil or ink/pen. Right now I scanned it and am looking at the image on the computer. I have other texture pieces I will be doing in this series. This is just the beginning.

Experiment: Writing-Without-Writing #007

Statement of Purpose: I was trying out some "ARABESQUES", a type of "Asemic Writing" that I call "Writing-Without-Writing". 10 inch x 20 inch, acrylic and oil pastel.

Procedure: I began by priming a canvas in a light yellow. Then I added scribbling onto the surface with a yellowish-orange marker. I then painted following the marker marks with a paintbrush with a kind of ochre orange, darkish. I then added markings in oil pastel, in a light sierra brown. I then covered the surface with oil pastel, light pink and light yellow, more like banana yellow, or daffodil yellow to be precise. Then I covered the whole thing with a white wash, with watered down gesso.

Notes: The painting is still drying so I don't know for sure yet what the results will be. So far though it looks pretty good. It is a classic "Writing-Without-Writing" painting, of Asemic Writing. I don't know what else to say.

Experiment: Difference Blend Mode #008

Statement of Purpose: I continued with my evolutionary art / evolutionary designs. I discovered the simple mathematical formula for the Difference function (type: inversion blend mode).

Procedure: I have made several hundred new little designs over the course of the last few days. The basic procedure is still to utilize the LEAST number of STEPS in the evolutionary design process and also to ONLY USE PRIMITIVE FUNCTIONS. Before now, though, I didn't have all the requisite MATH. Now I have it. The simple blend mode I am using, the "DIFFERENCE" blend mode / mixing mode, is simple: It takes two images and returns the absolute value of the difference between the two images. Another way to put it, by its formula is:   abs(Src - Dest). Yet another way to put it is: difference <image:pic1> <image:pic2> (Pop the two top images, push the difference image). Notes ensue.

Notes: So now I have the basic formular for the difference blend mode, which is an "Inversion" type blend mode / mixing bode. Difference reacts to the differences between the upper and lower layer pixels. Large differences lighten the color, and small differences darken the color. I have been experimenting with trying to JUST use difference, but it's difficult. I find myself still needing to use PIXELATE as well as POINTILLIZE. But I'm getting closer to the goal of having it done entirely "algorithmically", especially now that I have the basic mathematical formula, i.e. a basic blend mode is a function BM(L1, L2) = L3 that defines a pixel by pixel map of two image layers L1 and L2 to create a third image layer L3. In regular terms you might explain it like this: “In either layer, black has no effect and white inverts the other layer’s color.” Or else, it mixes with absolute value of the difference between base and blend layers. More experimentation needed. Trying to use the least number of primitive functions, trying to make it all done through numerical computation alone. I will be using Python's Imaging Library.

Experiment: WHITE POINT PROJECT TRUE FIRST PHASE 001

Statement of Purpose: This experiment is an experiment in the human sensory perception of the dynamic subtleties of all manners of off-white paint colors. Essentially, the idea is to trick the human eye. We do this by using colors that are infinitesimally "off-white", i.e. infinitesimally "close" to pure titanium white. It is part of a project called WHITE POINT which was inspired by a close friend and retired printer M.J. from Brooklyn, when he began teaching me the intricacies of modern color theory. He is also one of the founders and chief researchers for the Nemetics project.

Procedure: The procedure so far is very simple: I merely "primed" my canvas with a color that was a mixture of roughly 95% titanium white and 5% what might be called "canary yellow". (In this case it was cheap acrylic paint without standard pigment metadata, it was called just "bright yellow". The canvas had already been primed with three coats of Gesso (white). I added the first coat of infinitesimally off-white banana yellow, mostly white, with only a pinch of yellow. Now it is drying. I am waiting to see what comes next. The way I work is I go by "treatments" and this coat of paint is the first official "treatment" (in what I call process-painting or procedural painting.)

Notes: Like all of my other Projects, the White Point Project is an open-ended series, what I call an "ongoing series". It will contain a collection of paintings that will go on over the course of a few years. The collections of images will also have digital counterparts, digital images and ambient experimental sound designs. I will also be writing a great deal of stuff, from poetry to novelistic writings, liner notes, further documentation and so forth. This is the first official SERIOUS work in the White Point Project. Now I wait for the paint to dry.

Experiment: WHITE POINT PROJECT FIRST PHASE SECOND TREATMENT - CONTINUOUS YELLOWING OF CANVAS

Statement of Purpose: For the second treatment for the first White Point Painting, I wanted to take the yellowing a little further than I did in the first step,immediately prior to this one. The goal is to go step by step and to be very disciplined and strict about following the time-tested Algorithm. I will need to do several dozen "treatments" or "layers" if you will, before I really start talking business with this painting and also with this current first series in the White Point Project. The idea right now though is to just give the painting a little "character", that is, to give the CANVAS some "personality". Priming is one thing, it's just your base coat, or baseline. It's the foundation, in this case it was standard Gesso verging on titanium white. That gives me my luminosity and brilliance, for starters. The current treatments/layers/coats, though, are meant to DISTRESS THE CANVAS. Let's proceed.

Procedure: The firstmost procedure in this step was to add some "canary yellow" or "bright yellow" (really just a variant of Cadmium yellow) with a LARGE BRUSH (medium-large, depending on what you consider large or not), using a DRY-BRUSH TECHNIQUE. I did some dry brush slowly across the entire surface, and then continued until the acrylic paint was well "imbued" into the surface. I used a very small amount of paint, just enough to say that I actually used paint and not just thin air, but no more than that. I then began to scratch the surface with a large palette knife (medium, depending on what you consider a large palette knife). I went at it with the palette knife, going very fast at times and then slower at times, varying the pressure. I got all "artsy" about it, like I was a sword-fighter fighting pirates with a rapier. Now I am letting it dry and METICULOUSLY INSPECTING the surface to see how the paint sets, how it dries, what other CHARACTERISTICS/TRAITS/QUALIA/EFFECTS might show up in the process.

Notes: This was a good second treatment. It was a two-part treatment, consisting of a) DRY-BRUSH and then b) WORK WITH THE PALETTE KNIFE. The color applied was a variant of Cadmium yellow, cheap acrylic with not much pigment. I like this cheap acrylic paint with very little real pigment - compared to professional quality acrylics - because it is nice and watery/fluid AND the fact that it has substantially less pigment is actually a BLESSING. It means that the paint doesn't actually do a very good job of COVERING THE SURFACE. I mean it works just fine for most purposes, but I like to add water to it to make it more of the consistency that you'd use for a WASH, say, or SPLATTER (a little bit less than what you'd use to wash and spatter, but still much more watery than usual, i.e. closer to watercolor than standard acrylic). Hey, to each his own taste, right?
